2221.56s: people that I asked say all of it
2223.64s: wonderful thank you but if Michelle
2225.24s: needed a little more convincing the
2227.36s: answer was in the cash register you know
2229.76s: for 60 customers we need $50 per person

5575.12s: Gourmet flavor combinations you decide
5577.08s: if you want chicken portella mushroom
5579.20s: New York strip it can take up to like 20
5581.56s: minutes because there's so many
5582.80s: different combinations and so many
5584.24s: different options you have on our menu
5586.20s: then you decide if you would like it in
5587.92s: a roll as a sandwich on a bit of lettuce
5589.96s: as a salad or just as an
5591.96s: entree I can't even too much stuff while
5596.12s: the waitresses struggle with the menu
5598.40s: Gordon hopes to observe Sebastian
5600.28s: leading the kitchen but that is not the
5602.60s: case cute I'm selling uh table uh 100 I
5606.92s: got the cilano give me the shrimp
5608.48s: Pittsburgh with a capry salad it's
5610.12s: coming in 20 seconds I love to cook
5612.20s: that's my passion I love to cook so it's
5613.96s: crazy but my strong point is when we
5616.00s: busy all of this all of this right all
5618.04s: all of
5620.48s: this it's
5622.36s: frozen and then you deep fry it that
5625.80s: goes in a burger
5627.36s: buty hell is there anything that's ever

5648.88s: factory and it comes
5650.72s: in processed mashed
5653.76s: potato noticing the lack of fresh food F
5657.92s: Gordon heads to the fridge to confirm
5659.92s: his suspicions and what he finds is a
5662.64s: key reason as to why the restaurant is
5664.92s: failing well it's definitely processed a
5669.04s: fridge stocked with prepackaged frozen
5671.80s: food nothing's fresh made this all
5674.12s: bought in sauces yes sir this one's a
5676.36s: buying yes yes Buy in yes I don't think
5680.28s: we should be serving as much of the
5682.56s: stuff that we do out of cans I think
5684.08s: that most of the stuff we serve out of
5685.44s: cans we could probably make that inhouse
5687.84s: where is your uh your bought in though
5691.04s: and to Gordon's amazement even the pizza
5693.76s: dough is Frozen at this Pizzeria and you

5698.48s: think it's one of the best Frozen DS
5700.52s: I've seen and uh it's the only way we
5703.16s: can right now to save a dollar I got to
5706.40s: be in there with the presence of a
5708.36s: worldclass chef in the house Sebastian
5710.88s: decides it's time to take over in an
5712.76s: attempt to impress Chef Ramsey basil Lou
5715.88s: Pizza us three work here okay thank you
5718.36s: very much I got it L I can do it I can
5721.00s: do it if I just moved Lou through

5725.08s: uh more useful at that point and I could
5727.28s: kind of just regain things I have no

6287.12s: attitude from the staff the real work
6289.12s: starts tonight there's no excuse
6292.00s: although Sebastian craves success he has
6294.72s: been resistant to change and now he's
6297.24s: about to face his biggest fear first
6299.40s: thing we'll do is play to our strength
6302.08s: okay kind of noticed that he was holding
6303.88s: two menus one being mine and one being
6306.60s: the change that I think I was most
6308.12s: afraid of and uh that really made me
6310.76s: nervous what I'm going to confirm now is
6313.68s: that the confusion has gone gone yeah is
6317.32s: a confusion gone is Sebastian's 20
6320.08s: ingredient mix and match flavor menu
6322.36s: with pre- processed frozen food it looks
6324.68s: like a can of dog food and in its place
6327.52s: are made to order items using fresh and
6329.92s: homemade ingredients just have a look
6332.40s: let me read you through the menu first
6334.44s: okay pizzas all cooked order on our very
6337.16s: own wood burning oven a margarita a
6339.56s: salami a vegetarian and then the Entre

6351.24s: amazing chance to succeed hair if you
6353.88s: keep it simple I like the new menu it's
6356.40s: simple the fresh product and the fresh
6358.60s: dough that's a big thing for me take
6360.60s: away the intimidation Sebastian play to
6362.92s: your strengths use what you've got when
6366.12s: Gordon showed us the new menu I think it
6368.08s: was a bit overwhelming for Sebastian's
6370.12s: ha are you upset there's no photos on
6371.88s: there there's uh photographs on the menu
6374.56s: there's pictures of the food I took
6376.68s: those
6377.72s: myself no no the photos uh isn't the
6381.12s: thing that I'm concerned of it's just uh
6383.60s: it's it's it's the change I was scared
6385.64s: of are you worried about the size of the
6387.68s: menu no the size isn't the concern it's
6390.72s: uh I don't see any uniqueness you're not
6393.52s: going to now ask me to turn around and
6394.96s: say what you gave me in terms of pizza
6396.60s: was unique I've created a unique menu
6399.32s: that nobody else has and Chef Gordon
6401.68s: said I quote him I've never seen a menu
6403.92s: like this before so I'm assuming that
6406.08s: it's quite unique to him also stop
6408.20s: trying to be too clever don't try to be
6410.84s: too smart if you are you know anxious
6414.64s: about 20
6416.56s: combinations it's 20 times confusing I
6420.04s: thought that'd be more compromise with
6421.72s: my menu I didn't expect it to be just
6424.12s: completely gone I love that
6426.96s: menu you tried for 2 and 1 half years
6431.16s: and it hasn't worked that's the end of
6434.12s: that
6435.48s: chapter with the Academy Awards falling
6438.12s: on the same night as the relaunch Gordon
6440.44s: decides that this coincidence should be
6442.24s: taken advantage AG of and is rolling out
6444.72s: the red carpet for an Oscar night party
6447.44s: and Sebastian's is fully booked we going

16937.08s: mouth well a Rian can't even cook a
16939.36s: simple mushroom risoto it's a big worry
16942.76s: Gordon didn't like the food didn't seem

16948.12s: good right now if you're going to be a
16949.84s: restaurant ter at least know what your

16956.08s: like okay take a seat sure sit down
16959.76s: right um that was interesting um

16963.96s: is that canned crab that's not fresh
16965.44s: crab me it it's canned crab when I ask
16968.44s: very politely is the crab meat fresh the
16970.56s: waiter told me yes of course it is the
16972.40s: waiter told you that was fresh crab meat

16989.32s: chopped salad I mean it's hideous just
16991.44s: have a taste of
16993.68s: that my 8-year-old daughter could cook
16996.04s: better than that probably from anyone
16998.28s: else I would have threw a table over and
16999.56s: threw them out honestly your food's
17003.53s: [Music]
17005.64s: crap he's a little harsh and he got to
17008.88s: be a little abusive on the
17011.48s: food oh [ __ ] what the hell they doing we
17015.32s: get into if you think that you're going
17017.20s: to continue running this business
17020.20s: serving that [ __ ]
17021.60s: you may as well turn this place into a
17022.84s: museum no one's going to come back for
17024.88s: this I was pissed real pissed I wanted
17028.64s: to take the plate and smash it on top of
17030.48s: the chef's
17031.75s: [Music]
17036.68s: head in order to fully understand all
17039.52s: the issues of the Old Stone Mill it's
17041.84s: time to get tight Li Dean to open up and
17045.08s: these questions may not be comfortable
17046.64s: Dean but unless I understand the full
17049.16s: scenario then I can't get this place
17051.40s: back
17052.16s: online one thing I'd like to know is the
17056.48s: financial
17058.20s: situation are you aware of the current
17060.36s: financial situation
17061.84s: Bara um he kind of keeped me in the dark
17064.72s: a little bit so I don't want how to
17066.00s: worry no reason for her to share these
17069.00s: anxiety and nerves that I have totally
17074.32s: unnecessary I try not to bring it
17078.04s: up it's always easier just to kind of
17081.24s: not think about what's going on here and
17083.20s: that's probably one of the reasons why I
17084.80s: don't come down very often to the
17087.28s: restaurant because what you don't know
17090.16s: can't hurt you I just choose not to deal
17092.12s: with it right now I'll let him deal with
17093.72s: it yeah but if the house gets taken away
17095.12s: and you lose that then you got every
17096.44s: reason to be
17097.44s: worried I mean the bottom line is you're
17099.76s: losing money correct every week every
17101.92s: week yes if we had to close yeah tonight
17107.84s: just switch everything off yeah what
17109.72s: would we ohe
17114.92s: half a million half a million
17118.12s: yeah it wouldn't be good for our
17120.08s: marriage I don't think if he would risk
17122.32s: you know everything that we possibly had
17124.32s: in the world got money tied up in the
17127.84s: home mortgage wise oh sure a mortgage a
17131.60s: second mortgage and a home equity line
17133.40s: God so that's backed up big time
17136.16s: yeah how do you manage in terms of
17138.28s: getting through month-to month in terms
17139.84s: of mortgage payments
17141.44s: suppliers salaries your salary what do
17144.48s: you want me to say it's it's you know
17145.96s: I'm in hell right
17148.04s: now please don't get upset I know I no
17150.96s: no it's crucial for me to understand
17153.28s: exactly where we are I've got to be
17155.00s: really Frank and honest that's why
17157.72s: you're
17158.65s: [Music]
17165.68s: here nothing is more telling to Gordon
17168.32s: than observing a full dinner service for

17191.92s: kitchen fried C chop salad CB cakes one

17381.32s: he yeah right now I just want to get
17384.64s: people their
17386.08s: food what's the matter with
17388.32s: this it's very salty mushroom
17394.24s: try your rot day is
17396.84s: disgusting you should it
17402.32s: back does it make you feel better if we
17404.56s: rush this to the table no I'm trying to
17407.36s: ask the chef about some formal standard
17408.88s: and you're just like get the [ __ ]
17410.32s: [ __ ] out because the lady asked me three
17411.96s: times about food I'm amazed you know
17413.64s: that more than
17415.60s: anything I don't know I don't know what
17417.48s: I don't know what you want me to say to
17418.52s: you your restant is on the
17420.52s: ass that's what I'm but it's done it's
17423.84s: done Gordon it's done I love the facade
17426.68s: you put across it you know that it's not
17427.84s: a facade it no it's not actually we were
17430.84s: just going to ask you about the
17433.80s: Roto salty I don't really like the tast
17436.60s: of it all
17441.80s: [Music]
17443.76s: what did they
17445.96s: say they sent back your favorite
17453.52s: Dish's Dean's willingness to send out
17456.12s: substandard Roto typifies what's wrong
17458.84s: with the Old Stone Mill in addition a
17462.16s: great deal of Dean's energy has gone
17464.00s: into beautifying the
17465.72s: restaurant but the menu has been
17468.24s: neglected I don't think you understand
17471.04s: the real reason why I'm here the
17473.56s: inconsistency of food is
17475.60s: obvious the food needs some serious
17478.80s: attention and yet no one seems to
17481.00s: address it I asked Michael are you happy
17484.36s: with the risoto he said no and you said
17487.48s: no I got to serve it I got to serve it
17488.60s: they' be waiting 50 minutes have you any
17490.48s: idea how much damage you're causing what
17492.72s: do you want what what do you want it's
17494.08s: not about what I want it's just what I'm
17496.80s: I'm mythed I'm not too sure if you're
17499.04s: actually hungry
17501.12s: for the change you know that it's one
17503.44s: thing to believe in a dream but it's
17505.20s: another thing to actually be in a Dream
17507.68s: World for every plate of food we
17510.56s: send we're narrowing the chances of this
17513.04s: place becoming successful and I think
17515.48s: you bully them into making sure that
17518.04s: they get
17519.08s: brainwashed to how you
17521.92s: think well let me tell you something
17524.80s: what you think is
17526.56s: wrong it's tough to get poked out all
17528.76s: day I feel like poking back right now
17532.52s: I'm trying to get through to you if I
17535.48s: can't get through to you I've got no
17537.56s: chance I think you're treating this like
17539.56s: a game how dare you accuse me of not
17541.64s: having a commitment how dare you I don't
17543.08s: dare you I'm telling you you're not
17544.28s: telling me anything you this is your own
17546.40s: figment of your imagination that I don't
17547.88s: have a commitment to this place Dean's a
17549.52s: fighter he's not going to back down from
17550.96s: a challenge did you just give me two
17553.20s: minutes you guys would you mind you
17555.00s: float on the customers coming around
17556.52s: blowing smoke up your ass that's right I
17558.20s: do when I ask people how their food is
17559.68s: they tell me it's good it makes me feel
17560.88s: good I don't R around my customers
17563.24s: kissing how was it please tell me you
17565.28s: don't go to the table ask people had a
17566.40s: meal with or no you you probably pay 10

17657.60s: prepared to change this place has got no
17660.52s: chance and you've had it all your own
17662.60s: [ __ ] way for such a long time and
17665.76s: it's not going to continue being like
17669.00s: that one thing that has to change
17671.56s: instantly
17673.26s: [Music]
17678.44s: you ironically it's Dean's fear of
17681.24s: failure that is preventing him from
17683.00s: making the necessary changes for success
17686.32s: but before Gordon can put his plan for
17688.36s: change into action he decides to explore
17691.20s: the local competition Italian Chinese
17694.48s: restaurant next door to
17697.08s: Pizer an American

17780.80s: hope he doesn't come back and throw me
17782.04s: under the bus the idea behind the
