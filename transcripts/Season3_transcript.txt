1690.04s: going to happen but you both own the
1692.68s: place and what I need to know from both
1694.68s: of you is that are you prepared to put
1698.80s: the Grievances your egos your
1701.84s: frustrations your anger aside and
1705.28s: completely focus on your baby and that
1708.80s: is the mahita restaurant cuz if you can

3720.20s: clear picture of how PJs was perceived
3722.40s: by the town but Chef Ramsey has more um
3726.12s: there's one big issue Eric there's

4740.44s: the most important thing is I saw two

4748.16s: Ramsey's done here is incredible I don't
4750.32s: really know how he knew how to go to the

4789.12s: seriously hope that tomorrow The Sun
4790.80s: Shines on PJ's Grill and into the future
4794.12s: cuz it deserves was
4796.39s: [Music]
4800.04s: it after Chef Ramsey left PJ's business
4803.64s: did improve but after a great deal of
4806.12s: thought Joe and madlin made the most
4808.40s: difficult business decision of their
4810.04s: life they decided to close PJ's Grill
4812.96s: and return to the construction
4815.41s: [Music]
4818.48s: business Ridgewood New Jersey an
4821.00s: affluent suburb well known for the sheer
4822.88s: volume of restaurants smack in the
4825.20s: middle of this Pleasant town is a
4826.96s: 5-year-old restaurant run by a former
4828.96s: Manhattan star Chef Paul bazini I'm a
4832.28s: very good Chef we got a full Diner room
4833.96s: drop another pan for four more here we
4836.24s: go I've always been in the industry and
4838.28s: worked my way up and became executive
4839.84s: chef and worked many places in Manhattan
4842.68s: that had a lot of notoriety I love you
4845.24s: love you too Paul has been recognized
4847.44s: many times throughout his career he has
4849.60s: been written up in several magazines
4851.52s: with some very positive reviews and I
4853.96s: absolutely thought the restaurant was
4855.36s: going to be a
4857.64s: success but Paul never anticipated the
4860.40s: transition from Star Chef to owner would
4862.96s: be so difficult I don't have any Focus
4865.28s: these days I wake up in the morning and
4866.76s: I say what direction should I go in
4868.16s: today should I cook should I shop should
4869.68s: I work in the front of the house should
4870.88s: I work on marketing should I pay bills
4872.56s: and he it's like overwhelming killing me
4875.24s: I think the pressure of owning the
4876.92s: restaurant has definitely beat him down
4878.84s: and his passion for food is not burning
4880.80s: as brightly as it once was clearly
4883.08s: what's going on with me in the kitchen
4884.44s: is is suffering there's your salad what
4887.24s: salad what table I'm confused I'm
4889.68s: confused yeah New York shft New York
4891.36s: shft new okay you're right I am
4893.04s: distracted I am frustrated I'm angry

4898.20s: somebody and then I'm frustrated with
4899.76s: the food and I'm slaming plates on cuz
4901.28s: the plate doesn't look the way that I
4902.40s: want it to look it's messy but let's
4904.48s: just go with it okay the result was
4906.60s: burnt I don't know is it supposed to be
4908.32s: spicy lot of complaints yeah so I heard
4911.44s: I don't feel like me I feel like
4912.96s: somebody else I feel like me looking at
4915.32s: somebody
4916.88s: else everyone knows that he's just not
4919.68s: good about criticism this needs to be
4922.08s: heated up these are perfect okay he gets
4924.64s: pissed off and he yells I don't have all
4926.76s: the tickets
4927.76s: memorized well that's why you have a
4929.72s: ticket yeah okay do you think if you had
4931.36s: a lot of money you wouldn't be so

4951.84s: need help we need direction we need
4954.08s: advice and my resume and all of my
4955.96s: accolades don't mean a hill of beans if
4959.04s: I can't make it work here his passion
4961.20s: for cooking defines him and I feel like
4964.44s: it's lost to him right now he needs to
4966.60s: get it back

7046.72s: tonight confirmed that you have an
7049.16s: identity mm the fresh pasta is out there
7054.04s: but truthfully as hard as this is for me
7057.96s: to say to you face to face honestly Paul
7062.32s: you haven't changed enough to convince
7065.28s: me that
7067.16s: this can turn
7070.96s: around I
7072.72s: was totally focused and totally
7074.64s: committed no no no no you weren't Paul
7078.92s: jef no no come on Big Boy the first
7080.96s: appetizer had raw squid not slightly

7092.32s: the kitchen back together I've never
7095.16s: worked this hard in launching a
7098.08s: restaurant the truth hurts Paul you've
7100.40s: got to start telling yourself some
7102.16s: serious home truths the way to becoming
7104.68s: a better Chef is to realize your
7105.80s: weaknesses and improve those weaknesses
7108.08s: I've taken all of the advice and I've
7109.80s: taken a lot of it to heart and I've seen
7111.56s: a lot of it of what I do is wrong here's
7114.00s: my advice at the heart of this
7116.08s: restaurant has to be you your food you
7119.92s: on the plate you have to stand up to the
7123.20s: plate and hold the resins I know that it
7125.92s: starts and stops with me and I know that
7127.48s: I have to be the leader and I know that
7128.92s: I have to command the troops and I take
7130.48s: responsibility for that you say all the
7133.44s: right things always but now it's time to
7136.24s: do the right
7139.64s: things rice can I
7143.56s: than I think that Chef Ramsey came in
7145.92s: and really identified the problems and I
7149.20s: think he certainly helped Paul and I
7151.36s: totally feel that all the tools we have
7153.76s: are enough to save the restaurant Chef
7156.40s: yes chef good luck thank you very much
7158.64s: appreciate everything appreciate all
7160.12s: your hard work and and everything done
7162.24s: for me it's over to you now I won't let
7164.92s: you down this experience has been
7166.40s: amazing I've been put on the path to
7168.48s: success and I'm really excited about
7170.12s: going forward please don't let yourself
7172.52s: down thanks very much good night good
7174.75s: [Music]
7177.28s: night what a week Ridgewood may have 60
7181.04s: restaurants within four blocks but I do
7183.52s: believe the new bazin is with its fresh
7185.20s: plasta can be a huge local success
7188.52s: unfortunately I'm just not sure about
7191.00s: Paul but nothing would make me happier
7193.76s: if you could prove me
7195.66s: [Music]
7198.64s: wrong after Gordon's departure Paul

9048.40s: limited very limited menu this menu is
9051.96s: so limited it's not going to be

9058.36s: so hard to help here yeah there's one
9060.60s: thing I need to say to you is that you
9062.56s: cannot be personal about Nostalgia that
9064.48s: hasn't worked and you have to embrace
9066.64s: change because if you're not going to
9068.52s: embrace change do yourself a favor shut
9071.72s: the shop and
9073.64s: retire she has to get used to it because
9076.24s: this is what's going to bring people
9077.56s: into this restaurant and Dell sitting
9080.08s: looking like she wants to throw herself
9082.04s: in front of a

10805.19s: [Music]
10809.56s: nice what is this all these people Chef
10813.44s: Ramsey knows that often the best way to
10815.20s: get his point across is through the
10817.08s: voices of others ladies and gentlemen
10819.48s: first of all good afternoon I was pretty
10821.52s: shocked to see all these people showed
10823.80s: up I really didn't know what to expect
10825.68s: thank you so much for coming it means a
10827.04s: lot for you guys to make an effort to be
10828.92s: here these are ex- customers that were
10832.24s: here at the beginning to support this
10833.60s: restaurant it's important that we
10836.84s: understand what went wrong when we had
10839.08s: the chance to open this restaurant
10841.28s: please find out what
10842.84s: happened I'd like to start okay over the
10846.16s: time we felt we weren't getting the
10847.60s: service that we wanted and the
10848.96s: creativity of the food was really
10851.80s: lacking um on two different trips I got
10854.68s: sick within like a 2 Monon period And
10856.76s: when I came here 2 months later I got
10858.64s: sick again and I kind of stayed away
10861.68s: defrosting food the whole table kind of
10863.60s: got stomach issues
10865.80s: afterwards ouch I guess I underestimated
10869.08s: the pallet of the common person some of
10871.76s: the items we freeze and as we've been
10873.68s: going through we're thinking that that's
10875.60s: probably what it is and we're not going
10877.00s: to freeze anymore so hopefully that will
10879.28s: take care of that issue and that's what
10880.72s: we're changing thank you for being so
10881.88s: honest I can vouch for Laura Frozen has
10884.44s: gone yes I can't wait to see you again
10888.08s: but next time it's going to be inside
10889.48s: the restaurant rather than outside thank

10893.60s: do that's an eye opener today speaking

12626.12s: owner's children 22-year-old Sammy and
12629.28s: 20-year-old Hana was it always a plan to
12632.28s: have both of you so involved from day
12634.96s: one it was an idea for us to come help
12637.36s: and when give them a break if they
12638.72s: needed to but not to be here every
12641.52s: weekend I most of the time don't even

12646.08s: but got to do what you got to do want to
12648.52s: help out the family so and here's my
12650.56s: worry honestly it's the level of
12652.76s: shortcuts that are currently going on in
12655.16s: this restaurant right has your father
12657.28s: given up yeah I think he definitely has
12660.04s: on the inside but he doesn't want to
12661.08s: show it do you ever tell him to just
12663.96s: stop take stock
12668.00s: rethink he doesn't really
12672.04s: listen please don't get upset I'm sorry
12674.60s: no no come on I just I know I
12677.32s: know I know D I I totally get it I'm
12680.68s: almost 21 should be living my own life
12685.40s: but I can't because I have to help out
12688.40s: my my family and I can't leave them
12691.92s: you're both incredibly committed and I
12694.44s: you know totally respect that level of
12695.76s: loyalty and what I'm more nervous about
12698.00s: than anything is the state of the
12699.68s: business where did you see the business
12701.56s: pretty much as far down as you can go
12703.44s: I've also recently like in the past year
12705.40s: given money
12707.16s: also and is it Mom that comes and ask
12710.16s: who it was my dad that asked so
12712.16s: initially I gave $110,000 and then half
12714.52s: a year ago he asked for 5,000 and I was
12716.68s: like of course you know how um from
12719.36s: working my photography my own personal
12721.36s: income if your family is asking you for
12723.52s: help I would help them right away I have
12727.36s: probably given my parents above
12730.08s: $20,000 decent chunk of change for a
12733.44s: 22-year-old I think there a
12736.40s: of
12737.96s: unfairness because you've both been
12740.32s: dragged into this through no choice of
12742.36s: your own you've got my
12744.64s: help I'm supporting every one of
12747.24s: you my family is hanging by a
12750.44s: thread there only so much I can

12758.12s: do in the short time that Gordon has
12760.64s: been at Sushi he has not only learned
12762.96s: that the restaurant is in shambles but

14280.68s: individuals seeking different Ambitions
14282.88s: with different attitudes and no one
14284.72s: singing off the same page but there's a
14287.12s: reconnect that's taken place there's

14343.84s: haven't seen that in a while we bug
14346.68s: working with each other and supporting
14348.96s: each other it's going to give us more
14350.68s: hope than we had before
14355.24s: what a week we made a lot of changes we
14357.60s: changed the equipment we changed the
14359.00s: menu and we changed the decor but what
14361.32s: this family failed to realized is that
14362.68s: their greatest asset was something I
14364.32s: could never have given them because it
14366.44s: was themselves and it's that that will
14368.68s: make this place
14371.28s: successful what a week Sara a th000
14375.01s: [Music]
14378.20s: o in the days that followed sushiko saw
14381.52s: a boost in business and Lisa and Akira
14383.76s: were working working as a team once
14385.48s: again all right let's clean up the place
14388.76s: yeah let's clean the space up here
14390.28s: recently they decided that in order to
14392.44s: maximize profits they would search out a
14394.68s: new location where the rents weren't as
14396.84s: high you have anything anything special
14398.96s: give me a call regardless of the
14401.36s: location the most valuable lesson this
14403.64s: family may have learned was not how to
14405.64s: run their business but how to appreciate
14408.36s: each
14411.68s: other just south of Los Angeles is the
14414.40s: picturesque Beach town of Manhattan
14417.12s: Beach 5 years ago Lisa hemt an ambitious
14420.96s: 23-year-old fresh out of USC business
14423.32s: school bought a restaurant called Leo D
14426.08s: Manhattan he guys how are you welcome to
14428.60s: Le did you ever I think I do surprise a
14430.80s: lot of people based on first impression
14433.44s: and seeing someone as young as I am and
14436.72s: female I think they are surprised thanks
14439.12s: for joining us most people still think
14442.44s: that my parents gave it to me or I
14444.72s: married somebody that gave it to me it
14446.88s: was just frustrating but at the same
14448.52s: time I know the
14450.20s: truth I went to USC and studi business
14453.80s: entrepreneurship so after I graduated
14456.12s: college I was bound and determined to
14458.16s: only work for myself but instead of
14460.32s: starting from scratch I started looking
14462.00s: at existing businesses with the staff
14464.72s: with customer base and Leo just seemed
14467.48s: like a real great
14469.20s: fit I don't think it looks good like
14472.32s: that one big table Lisa did not at that
14475.24s: time have the experience to run a full
14477.96s: restaurant in my opinion I think we
14479.64s: should separate them the only thing at
14481.40s: that point in time that I believe really
14483.08s: helped this restaurant be success was
14484.80s: that she did have a staff that had been
14486.52s: here forever four one sa L is very smart
14491.24s: person but she doesn't have a lot of
14493.16s: experience with restaurant I don't want
14494.76s: to hear complaints I don't want to hear
14496.60s: [ __ ] I just want to hang out if you see
14499.04s: a wine key I took it from Priscilla a
14502.12s: lot of times she gets things mixed up
14504.92s: like she considers me as a friend not as
14507.80s: a employee do you have this phone
14511.56s: number why are there Morocco they've
14514.76s: been there you put them there on your I
14516.72s: didn't I can't reach that Damian is bar
14520.96s: manager and someone that I have been
14525.24s: kind of dating in the last 6 months
14528.40s: thank you I don't think that I have a
14530.32s: title if she sees something that needs
14532.04s: to be done and we'll ask me to do it
14533.44s: I'll do it are you okay no give me these
14536.72s: just relax I kind of cross this fuzzy
14539.76s: line where I'm having him work here it's
14542.64s: probably a bad idea but I'm going to do
14545.36s: it
14546.23s: [Music]
14550.80s: anyways it's heartbreaking to me to see
14554.12s: other people choosing other restaurants
14556.76s: around here I struggle with why it's not
14561.20s: busier than it is if the little doesn't
14564.56s: change uh things here I don't think
14567.12s: we'll be open until the beginning of the
14569.56s: next year I've just been so frustrated
14572.88s: I'm barely making it by and um I can't
14577.36s: continue on like
14578.68s: [Music]
14584.64s: this parking lot is jammed so my big

17751.52s: the weird thing about the whole service
17753.76s: tonight every time something comes back

17805.16s: Chef Ramsey tried continually to get

17812.48s: out refuses to listen don't want to get
17814.76s: better do you what you've never ever

17863.44s: that's the most honest you've been all
17865.08s: day I told you that ear you don't need
17866.60s: to be so defensive with me tonight was
17869.12s: about observing or watching the [ __ ]
17870.88s: setup you have created a monster here
17873.08s: what are you suggesting are you
17874.76s: committed to making this place change
17877.88s: that's all I need to know before I'm out

17895.24s: stubborn [ __ ]
17897.52s: huh Andy's statement that he has opened
17899.88s: to change has kept Chef Ramsey around
17902.12s: for at least another day but Gordon is
17904.80s: fully aware that he is at the beginning
17907.20s: of a huge uphill battle take a seat sit
17911.04s: down and relax how cool is this terrific
17915.08s: right I wanted to come out and clear the
17917.56s: air because of this stigma
17920.56s: and your training and the proudness
17923.04s: that's defense mechanism but before we
17925.80s: start changing you have to understand
17928.48s: that we have to identify the problems
17930.08s: with the restaurant you've got to
17931.80s: understand where you've gone wrong and
17933.84s: when You' come downstairs with me I got
17934.84s: a little surprise for you sandwich would

21643.12s: taste of Denmark 8 years ago we knew it
21645.56s: was a good restaurant we knew it was
21646.80s: very popular and the whole idea for us
21649.84s: was to try and keep it as much the same
21652.52s: as possible so there would be little
21654.04s: change other than someone else greeting
21655.68s: them at the front door hi welcome to
21657.36s: Flemings how are you we were worried
21659.48s: about the fact that it said Fleming it
21661.24s: tastes of Denmark neither one of us know
21663.28s: much about Scandinavian food it doesn't
21665.72s: have cery in it does it we struggled to
21668.52s: try and find a chef to come in very
21670.32s: knowledgeable in Danish Cuisine we

22464.52s: unhappy diners I can make something like
22466.56s: uh coconut shrimp very quickly crab
22468.52s: cakes Chef Ramsey has seen enough of the
22470.64s: kitchen in action he's heard the
22472.36s: complaints about the food and knows that
22474.40s: many of the problem problems are not
22475.80s: caused by cooking alone holy

22483.48s: storage unit what the

22582.20s: place has clearly shown Chef Ramsey just
22584.92s: how far this once legendary restaurant
22587.16s: has fallen now I am seriously seriously
22590.24s: worried who [ __ ] yeah you're right
22592.52s: you're [ __ ] if I was a health
22594.16s: inspector now what would you
22596.36s: do you would take that product and
22598.56s: probably throw it out throw it out you
22601.20s: would continue serving one more plate of
22603.40s: food what do you think we're going to do
22605.40s: continue cooking I don't believe that
22607.12s: the food that's out here now is
22608.88s: contaminated in any way you don't
22610.80s: believe I never have seen that before if
22613.76s: I did I would have a fit but I was
22615.84s: surprised that Andy wasn't aware of that
22617.64s: I think he's had his head buried in the
22619.12s: s for the last seven years you took one
22621.72s: more thing I'm [ __ ] out of it there
22625.40s: are blinders at times when things get
22627.40s: tough I put them on and I just forge
22629.12s: ahead and you miss some things and you
22631.00s: miss some of
22632.36s: those Chef Ramsey is frustrated by
22634.80s: Andy's laid-back attitude so he decides
22637.12s: to try and get some answers from Andy's
22639.08s: wife
22641.08s: Suzanne I don't know where to start
22644.92s: okay I don't know what to tell you all I
22647.80s: can say is I'm
22649.16s: sorry trying to work with an owner
22651.28s: that's in denial is 10 times harder why
22654.36s: is he so
22656.48s: blaz I think he's probably in shock I
22659.16s: don't know I'm not him so I don't know
22660.68s: what he's doing right
22663.60s: now Suzanne if your husband doesn't
22667.56s: start realizing what he's doing wrong in
22670.28s: a big
22672.12s: way I can't help him I agree I
22675.84s: agree I feel let down by Andy this is a
22679.12s: huge huge wakeup call and if this
22682.64s: doesn't make any change nothing will I
22685.20s: don't know where to start
22687.32s: Suzanne what I do know is that right now
22690.04s: I don't feel too good about this
22697.04s: [Music]
22704.96s: one a dramatic change in the weather and
22707.48s: that's exactly what Flemings needs a big
22709.52s: dramatic change so I'm going to hit the
22710.92s: streets and find out what the locals
22712.64s: really want from their Fleming's
22713.96s: Restaurant
22716.16s: hello how are you good to see you guys
22718.48s: Now ladies have you heard of Flemings of
22720.48s: course nobody talks about it anymore
22721.92s: nobody says oh I was at Flemings let's
22723.68s: go back and try it out there's a new
22725.40s: owner and it went downhill have you
22726.88s: heard of Fleming's Restaurant actually I
22728.52s: have what's the word on the street not
22730.76s: so good food my parents used to go there
22733.28s: back in the day when it was good but I
22735.60s: didn't even know it was still open uh I
22737.24s: haven't heard any good reviews it's old
22739.76s: yeah it's uh it's a place my mom and dad
22741.80s: would probably love to go and you're not
22743.32s: going to go anywhere near the place
22744.36s: again not until something's done it's
22746.40s: extraordinary and this guy's adversed at
22748.20s: change but you got all those customers
22750.16s: standing on your
22751.88s: doorstep unbelievable so
22757.92s: sad Chef Ramsay's Grassroots research
22761.04s: clearly points out how damaged this
22762.84s: restaurant's reputation really is
22765.28s: ironically many of the people who work
22766.80s: at Fleming realize they are in desperate
22768.92s: need of change but there is one person
22771.96s: who doesn't agree with that
22773.64s: unfortunately it's the owner yesterday
22776.40s: was a really bad day I took the morning
22778.48s: this morning walked around the community
22779.92s: done my homework and really confirmed
22783.28s: this Danish restaurant is no longer Talk
22787.28s: of the Town so what I need from each and
22790.48s: every one of you is to be incredibly
22792.36s: honest let's talk about what's wrong
22794.44s: with the restaurant orando tell Andy
22798.24s: what this place needs I I believe we
22801.12s: need to build in new menu we need to
22803.36s: build in new food something more
22805.44s: attractive something more contemporary
22808.48s: you know that's my opinion right now
22811.64s: Crystal tell Andy why the rest is not
22815.00s: working you're scared you're going to
22817.84s: fail so instead of taking the jump and
22820.44s: the leap of actually doing what you want
22822.32s: to do you're scared that no one's going
22825.36s: to like it and you're going to lose
22827.68s: everything but the truth in the matter
22829.28s: is and either way you're going to lose
22831.08s: it if you don't do
22833.08s: something suzan
22835.32s: you and I spent time talking last night
22837.64s: you were pissed off tell your husband
22840.72s: what he needs to do to get this place
22843.08s: back on track in my opinion I think a
22846.44s: lot of people are afraid of change and
22848.84s: they don't change until they're brought
22850.76s: down to their knees cuz they're
22852.16s: terrified because it's easier to stay
22854.64s: with what they know than to risk change
22857.20s: and I think that has been Andy's fault
22860.48s: do you understand what she's saying yeah
22862.40s: I I her points are valid my how you to
22865.16s: respond to it how my my response to it
22867.48s: now is I'm just afraid to alienate the
22869.80s: people that we had and lose what we
22871.92s: have the only thing right now that's
22875.16s: going to save your business is a
22877.60s: dramatic
22882.20s: change it it's a long time coming and
22884.80s: it's it's time to do
22886.68s: it and he needs to take ownership of the
22889.36s: restaurant and I think Andy will buck up
22892.36s: now and take charge get ready for a
22895.24s: dramatic
22896.96s: [Music]
22899.08s: change Chef Ramsey knows that the
22901.28s: changes to Fleming cannot be subtle and
22903.64s: the most drastic change needs to be the
22905.32s: food so step one of his plan is to take
22908.08s: the restrictions off the kitchen and let
22910.28s: them
22911.08s: cook I want to spend the next 20 minutes
22913.68s: looking at the ingredients what we've
22915.04s: got and just cooking something and when
22917.24s: you start forget anything to do with
22919.84s: Danish people don't go out in South
22922.04s: Florida to dine Danish let's get that
22924.40s: right right yeah think popular think
22927.16s: Trend and think where we are okay let's
22929.88s: do some cooking four of us together
22933.88s: yes I want to see a little bit of flare
22936.80s: oh yeah baby that's going to be asome
22939.28s: something
22940.44s: different that's like we looking for
22942.60s: that's like we ready for that that's tun
22944.56s: is beautiful is it m in your mouth let's
22947.48s: go
22948.88s: ready with the shackles taken off the
22951.40s: kitchen have come up with a number of
22952.92s: exciting non-danish menus items that's
22955.36s: definitely not our menu Chef Ramsey has
22957.84s: added a SE tuna now to make sure
22960.24s: everyone is on the same page he shares

22975.52s: good and I love this seeing those dishes
22978.48s: and tasting them it's a better
22979.88s: reflection of what Miami is and I think
22983.08s: it'll draw in a big crowd very nice very
22987.04s: nice I think change is difficult for
22988.88s: everybody what we've been doing for the
22990.68s: same 25 years is not working anymore
