1310.20s: Fried Chicken despite the ongoing chaos
1312.64s: in the kitchen dishes somehow make their
1315.28s: way to the dining room and that's the
1317.60s: result

1336.20s: Blackberry St ROM ly H what a
1340.90s: [Music]
1343.60s: welcoming coming up is her way or the
1346.44s: highway when the staff tries to get
1348.20s: through to shell I have been open-minded
1350.60s: she goes from the defensive to the
1352.36s: offensive I'm dead I want you to leave
1355.28s: tell me to go I go and then a dinner
1357.08s: service Blackberry spirals out of
1359.20s: control I don't want to hear it leaving
1361.40s: Chef Ramsey
1362.76s: wondering if this restaurant can be
1365.20s: saved now you walk away bye goodbye
1368.44s: goodbye see you
1370.32s: later it's day two at blackberries and
1373.24s: Chef Ramsey knows that before he can
1375.00s: Implement changes he has to focus on how
1377.64s: this restaurant is run R and so he
1379.56s: starts the day with a staff meeting I
1382.04s: want to go round now to identify things
1385.04s: that you know that are wrong with the
1386.80s: business and things that you'd like to
1388.44s: change in the
1389.84s: business I think um one thing is I've
1393.44s: known Shelly we kind of grew up together
1397.00s: and she is a control freak if she does
1400.32s: not see it being implemented the same
1403.00s: way that she would do it she's going to
1404.96s: jump in and she's going to take over but
1406.80s: is it overbearing is it too contr tring
1409.52s: yes it's either her way or the highway
1412.68s: and it inhibits anyone to show off their
1414.24s: skills or what they can do or what they
1415.92s: can bring to the restaurant but you have
1417.76s: someone that's down your throat
1419.16s: constantly and really doesn't know what
1420.80s: they're doing if you were so right
1423.28s: obviously the restaurant wouldn't be fa
1424.68s: or in a situation there is it no but
1426.24s: it's a very valid point you've employed
1429.08s: some talented individuals okay
1433.20s: porsa Shelly needs to learn how to
1435.64s: delegate responsibility she can't be
1438.20s: hand on all the time it creates a
1440.40s: problem oh my God Shelly in all honesty
1445.12s: you take somebody out of what they're
1446.80s: supposed to be doing and make them do
1448.40s: something else and that's one thing you
1450.00s: got to realize and that happens more
1451.48s: often than I think that you talk too
1453.40s: much and you know too much this is the
1455.80s: attitude that's what makes this so
1458.64s: rough one time or another everybody has
1461.24s: been pushed off their position Dwayne
1464.56s: calm down I'm not Al was and upset I try
1467.12s: to tell you something get you to calm
1469.64s: down I'm not I'm not I want you to leave
1472.40s: good night I don't have a problem so
1474.16s: much for your cuz the honesty hurts the
1476.44s: true we're going to fix that we're going

1480.88s: fix DNE just be with me for 2 minutes
1484.68s: sit down please okay goodness what is
1489.00s: wrong with you I made one comment what's
1492.04s: become evidence is how fragmented we are
1495.00s: but that starts from the top shf shell
1499.12s: have to learn how to listen everybody
1501.52s: tries to communicate with her and
1503.84s: support her but if she's going to be
1506.16s: stubborn and not listen the doors will
1508.92s: close and that would just break my heart
1511.64s: I mean tremendously from now on in open
1516.56s: honest dialogue got it yes
1522.44s: shell Shel I can't hear you I'm

1533.56s: concerned Why did you say that this is
1536.52s: not a joke your livelihood is on the
1539.16s: line I mean you're in a serious serious
1541.72s: position there's no reason why you
1544.56s: cannot be open and honest because my I'm

3971.88s: see what else was in the neighborhood
3973.24s: instead of living in the denial that our
3975.28s: food is fantastic your dishes set an
3979.44s: impression and they remain in people's
3982.68s: memories so let's take a look at these

4020.48s: Sur food like that chefs opened my eyes
4022.28s: to the to the neighboring competition

4031.60s: direction let's get back to the owners

4042.12s: town with Michael finally realizing how
4044.92s: much is restant has slipped Gordon's

5933.80s: another no one's monitoring standards

6046.00s: really don't I'm
6048.80s: confused but you've got to get out of
6050.92s: denial and there's got to be a fire in

6063.04s: night this restaurant is definitely
6065.20s: taking talami everything falls on my lap
6068.56s: and it's wearing me out it's a tough
6071.43s: [Music]
6075.64s: life after the death of his father Mike
6078.52s: has been in a downward spiral and so has
6080.92s: his restaurant he has clearly lost his
6083.00s: way
6084.08s: and Chef Ramsey knows that in order for
6085.80s: this restaurant to have any chance of
6087.52s: surviving how are you morning I'm good
6089.56s: how are you he has to put Mike back on
6091.64s: course it's quite nice getting out of
6093.28s: the restaurant yeah it almost feels like
6095.84s: it's um like a ticking time bomb in
6098.36s: there and I'm concerned I think really
6101.80s: about Dad I had a chat with him last
6104.16s: night and he was for the first time
6106.40s: being open and honest he admitted he
6108.72s: lost control and sadly that he was on
6111.00s: the verge of giving up and we can't give
6114.72s: up and then I noticed something
6116.96s: upsetting last night is the amount of
6119.48s: drink I feel like he's trying to drown
6121.52s: his SS yeah definitely I think he's very
6124.60s: lost right now everything fell on his
6126.56s: shoulders after after Nelly passed away
6128.48s: and it's just so much more
6129.72s: responsibility and that's a lot to
6131.72s: handle yeah I don't think he's got over
6134.00s: losing his father I don't think he's got
6135.36s: over that hurdle I don't think so now no
6137.92s: I mean we were he was back at work you
6139.80s: know and there was no time off it was he
6142.68s: was just there
6143.68s: I think he's hurting I think deep down
6145.12s: inside I I don't see a happy now you can
6147.92s: tell that he's hurting mhm like
6151.34s: [Music]
6153.64s: always that's awful I mean he's got two
6155.84s: kids in college and like what does he
6157.68s: have to show for it like he's working so
6159.96s: much harder than he should be and like
6162.28s: he's suffering so much and I hate to see
6165.32s: him like
6166.76s: that the Dad is driving himself into the
6169.96s: ground yeah and I don't know how much
6172.84s: longer
6173.64s: you know he can continue to do
6176.04s: it you know it's about time we actually
6178.72s: turned around and said hey Dad I want
6181.08s: you back and I want you to listen and I
6183.08s: want you to slow down he's your dad
6186.48s: you're his last hope and last night that
6189.32s: was a cry for help you think you can
6191.04s: help them yeah of course I'm here to
6193.04s: help but I can't help unless he's
6195.60s: prepared to change
6199.40s: himself hello sh morning Mike how are
6202.92s: you
6203.88s: a uh tough night last night right
6206.84s: yeah quite I came to see the girls
6210.48s: because I think the bottom line is Mike
6212.32s: you mean a lot to this family and
6215.08s: there's no doubt in how hard you're
6217.28s: working but you're not a machine you're
6220.00s: not 25 Mike you you're 55 and the girls
6223.76s: have got something to say and I want you

6237.12s: really difficult seeing you like
6238.56s: struggling this much and working so hard
6240.92s: you have to let go a little bit and not
6244.52s: work as hard as you are I understand I
6247.44s: understand I don't know how to let go I
6248.96s: don't trust anybody else but I think
6251.20s: that in order for you to be able to
6252.68s: function like this you need to let some
6254.72s: other people take on some
6255.68s: responsibilities I would love to take
6258.12s: take off and let them I don't TR trust
6261.08s: them enough to do it you know you have
6263.16s: your guard off all the time do you don't
6265.44s: like trust anyone so what do we need a
6266.96s: nicer mic is that what you're saying no
6268.84s: we need a more Open
6271.36s: Mic
6274.44s: okay so I'm willing to give a shot a
6278.44s: change here and you're going to open up
6280.56s: though and like let people actually just
6282.36s: talk to you it's not going to be an
6283.80s: overnight thing but I'm willing to
6285.68s: listen I've been wanting to tell my dad
6288.44s: these things for a long time already and
6291.64s: I really hope that he was listening in
6293.40s: because the problem with the restaurant
6294.88s: isn't that we need a decoration change
6296.80s: the fact is that my dad needs the
6304.72s: change after spending the morning at

8668.64s: separate the conflict with these two
8670.80s: families the clients can feel it and who
8673.04s: wants to go to a place where the
8675.04s: atmosphere is not the most Pleasant so

8859.40s: that is the feeling of your team and
8862.28s: they are here for you and you have to
8864.32s: listen to them we cannot start to fix
8866.56s: this restaurant unless we fix each other
8869.12s: first so I'm sorry you feel it's upset

8889.72s: I think Grace needed to hear all these
8891.76s: criticisms she still is a little bit in
8894.20s: denial of the way that she is and how it
8896.72s: intimidates other people I think
8898.84s: eventually she will come through true
8900.48s: but uh it's going to be hard for her you
8902.48s: take a seat just a big deep breath the
8905.08s: owners were
8908.64s: listening the minute I walked in here I
8911.08s: could feel the level of intensity it was
8914.20s: it it was depressing nobody was being
8916.44s: honest with each other and if we
8918.20s: continue to fall along these lines and
8921.44s: remain broken this restaurant is going
8923.56s: to close and whether you like it or not
8927.00s: you're all tied together and if we can't
8929.44s: work and communicate together as a
8931.28s: family then you shouldn't be in business
8933.52s: because it's unfair it's

11207.72s: why aren't we serving Burgers like that
11209.96s: because I thought the Wu meat was better
11213.80s: you got your priorities wrong cuz of the
11215.60s: word wagu sounds glamorous and expensive
11217.72s: it doesn't mean to say it's going to
11218.52s: deliver you the most tastiest burger my
11220.68s: question to you is that if you know that
11222.72s: your burgers are better than what you're
11226.24s: cooking currently what the [ __ ] are you
11228.56s: doing I'm forced into making what they
11231.88s: like me to make if I try to do a change
11235.28s: I'm persecuted for making a change he
11237.20s: wants to blame me for everything in the
11238.80s: kitchen and I'm not that powerful Chef
11240.64s: Ramsey I'm a 64y old woman I I can't
11243.56s: control all this what he's saying how am
11245.84s: I that powerful do you see a chef hat on
11248.16s: me do You See Me swirling the pans or
11250.44s: making the Patties or chopping the
11252.44s: mushrooms or putting the salt on I mean
11254.60s: what really frustrates me is the fact
11256.20s: that I get served that mediocre crap and
11258.92s: that thing is seasoned beautifully
11260.40s: cheese CU it that little bit of
11262.40s: saltiness absolutely delicious thank you
11265.44s: Chef Jen whatever
11268.56s: Jen what she going this is
11273.28s: ridiculous David has proven to Chef
11275.36s: Ramsey that thing is season view for me
11277.52s: absolutely delicious he can cook a
11279.32s: winning Burger when he is not confined
11281.32s: by Jen and Allen's
11283.16s: recipes but the chef's success doesn't
11285.92s: appear to be appreciated by one of the
11288.00s: owners Jen Jen come
11291.56s: on where's
11293.92s: Jen thank you Jen got up from the
11297.76s: tasting because Jen wanted me to be the
11301.28s: reason that their pitiful restaurant
11304.32s: hasn't made it Jen what's the matter
11307.00s: what's
11308.28s: wrong I'm 64 years old i' I've been
11311.76s: through many many different
11313.84s: situations my situation is to get this
11317.12s: restaurant productive prosperous it's
11320.36s: not about some bully or some fool is
11323.08s: that why you just walked out because my
11324.76s: heart hurts what do I do it's that a
11326.76s: false thing if I have to sit there and
11328.76s: smile and say that that everything's
11331.20s: fine I can't do that no you just did
11333.20s: tell me what's going on that's all I'm
11335.72s: facing a bully who has been abusive to
11338.12s: me who's we need to address this but
11340.32s: just for you to get up and walk out it
11342.32s: just looks a little bit weird I need you
11345.24s: and I think more importantly I think
11346.96s: Alan
11348.60s: does yeah okay please right I'm okay I
11353.12s: feel a good energy from Chef Ramsey if I
11356.20s: was here to be in a POS positive place I
11358.68s: felt very comfortable in coming back
11362.20s: okay Jen's back found her uh yeah she
11364.72s: got a little bit upset and she was uh I
11366.68s: understand well because I I I know that
11369.04s: the chef can deliver this kind of
11372.20s: burger and should have delivered it
11374.12s: before why did Jin just walk out the
11376.04s: back door that was a different issue
11378.20s: that's got nothing issue because fail
11381.00s: because your a bully you say nasty
11384.28s: things to me let me explain something I
11386.44s: don't care what you
11389.08s: 8 to 12 chefs walk out since the day I
11393.16s: walked in here you want me to fail I

12398.20s: deliberately attacking my restaurant wow
12401.12s: there's the actual yelpers every yelper
12403.72s: lies they hurt and damage restaurant
12406.84s: by doing this okay Alan listen carefully
12409.36s: you were 100% convinced that those
12412.04s: negative reviews were part of a
12414.60s: conspiracy is there a plot against you
12417.44s: from Yelp to close this business no
12419.60s: question in my mind Alan there's someone
12421.76s: I'd like you to meet this lady is the
12423.76s: community manager for Yelp Katie
12426.44s: Burbank hi now I know that you're very
12428.92s: frustrated but they're all real we're
12431.36s: all real all of our reviews mean
12433.20s: something it's feedback for you to use
12435.44s: however you'd like
12437.16s: hi um I'm the big Rooter for you guys I
12440.12s: am and I wanted to love your burger so
12442.36s: bad like I love burgers and I didn't
12446.28s: came in expecting to spend $26 on an
12448.80s: amazing Burger it uh wasn't amazing I
12452.04s: was expecting an explosion of flavor but
12454.24s: I pretty much didn't taste anything what
12456.04s: I got in the burger was an extremely
12460.88s: unflavored meat that had the consistency
12463.76s: of a nasty loaf of meat Lo
12466.84s: I absolutely detest what served at your
12469.64s: restaurant I'm not like an avid yelper
12472.00s: in fact I created the account just to
12474.76s: comment on your place because that
12476.08s: burger was so disappointing in the end
12478.32s: it was a big whoos smar of a horrible
12482.00s: experience I to signed up for Yelp just
12484.56s: to write a review and it was the one and
12486.28s: only Yelp review we have ever written
12488.96s: interesting that customers are purposely
12491.00s: opening accounts to post a comment wrote
12493.28s: a review I received a response from you
12495.68s: that basic basically told me I didn't
12497.12s: know what I was talking about and it was
12498.64s: essentially my fault that I had a bad
12500.08s: review I wrote my review on Yelp only to
12503.28s: be met with sort of a barrage of emails
12505.52s: from you and you told me that you
12507.04s: thought we were the competition and you
12508.60s: told me that you thought we were out to
12510.40s: get you at one point you threatened to
12512.32s: turn us over to the hate crime division
12514.40s: of the
12515.56s: LAPD instead of saying sorry come back
12518.36s: in I will make it better it was kind of
12520.60s: an attack and to me it felt like maybe
12523.04s: this place is hopeless because they're
12524.48s: not taking the criticism like is this
12526.92s: place
12529.36s: doomed um Jen am I keeping you up Dy
12531.80s: would you like a
12533.24s: blanket I was angry at my mom for
12535.44s: falling asleep I don't know what she was
12537.08s: trying to pull there we've been here 10
12539.20s: minutes and I'd like you to look good
12541.24s: but to watch you sit there and snore I
12543.20s: think is the height of Bad Manners I was
12545.20s: incredibly frustrated I thought this is
12546.88s: not going to work unbelievable I mean
12550.32s: unbelievable they're customers no no no
12552.72s: no no you're missing my point completely

12556.88s: every single one of these people here
12559.52s: everyone you you you enough this is
12562.80s: ridiculous you have to stop caring about
12565.64s: yel he's trying to get you off of this
12567.88s: [ __ ] man you're my point I'm not missing
12570.12s: the point you are so obsessed with this
12571.80s: becoming five stars four stars no it's
12574.16s: an arbitrary number man you're concerned
12576.72s: about this so much and these people are
12578.40s: actually honest they told you that they
12580.44s: have a terrible [ __ ] time it's

12585.52s: about y I only care about Del no no
12589.30s: [Music]
12591.20s: enough Chef Ramsey gathered yelpers to
12594.00s: prove to the family and to the staff the
12596.20s: real damage they have caused to the
12597.76s: reputation you were 100% convinced that
12600.64s: those reviews were part of a conspiracy
12603.56s: and to show Allan that this is not a
12605.44s: conspiracy no no no no no you're missing
12607.92s: my point of enough enough this is
12610.20s: ridiculous and these people are actually
12612.40s: honest and they told you that they have
12614.20s: a terrible [ __ ] time appr this is
12616.72s: ridiculous you make excuses I don't care
12619.24s: about I care about food no no

12627.68s: way my son blasted me Alan he didn't
12630.52s: blast you he just told you that you're
12632.20s: worrying about the wrong things okay
12634.48s: there's someone I'd like you to
12636.76s: meet the owner and the executive chef of
12639.16s: The Foundry on Melrose Eric good morning
12642.32s: sir Eric's going to give a little
12644.12s: insights to how he deals with
12647.28s: Yelp you know one of the things that I
12650.48s: think you always have to be very careful
12651.88s: of when it comes to Yelp is you can't
12654.32s: look at these and take them as personal
12655.80s: attacks and try to adjust them at the
12657.60s: end of day it's not personal if it was
12659.44s: personal they'd come up and tell it to
12660.52s: your face you know I get one C reviews I
12663.20s: get five C reviews I get the whole board
12664.88s: you know even my my grilled cheese
12666.12s: sandwich everybody says best sandwich
12667.84s: around I real reviews to say it's the
12669.96s: worst hch I've ever had and what do I do
12672.12s: do I change the grilled cheese no but if
12674.24s: 18 people tell me my my Burgers under
12676.76s: seasoned 18 of them are telling me that
12679.60s: there's got to be a problem and it's
12681.44s: worth looking at and like he said if
12683.16s: there's 18 complaints about one
12684.64s: particular item trust me we've got it
12686.40s: wrong so we move and we change course we
12689.16s: take Yelp as an advantage to reposition
12691.96s: ourselves and we listen to a consensus
12693.96s: that's what we
12695.32s: do the only thing I ever get wrong on is
12698.16s: I don't like unfairness I was focused on
12700.52s: that wrongly and I apologize look any
12703.96s: review that you get from somebody is Fe
12706.12s: back and if you're too obsessed about
12708.00s: why they're saying it and not what
12709.20s: they're saying you're going to find
12710.64s: yourself in trouble thank you Chef
12713.56s: Ramsey maybe I'm obsessed and I'm wrong
12716.60s: I agree with you I'll never ever speak
12719.12s: about this again and I appreciate it
12721.16s: enormously because I hope we can learn
12723.68s: from this and improve hopefully
12726.56s: something got through to my dad but he's
12728.36s: stubborn the guy has a gift of blissful
12733.04s: ignorance a gift we have to give back to
12736.08s: the restaurant and uh we got a lot to do
12738.40s: I trust you're going to give us one more
12739.76s: go Burger Kitchen and thank you for your

12753.04s: has gotten through to Allan about his
12754.56s: so-called Yelp conspiracy forget it gone
12758.00s: gone from my mind we're over
12761.72s: Yelp he now moves on to a much bigger
12764.32s: problem of the restaurant there's
12766.00s: something else that I need to talk to
12767.52s: you all
12768.92s: about there is so much tension in this
12771.72s: restaurant from this family it is
12773.72s: extraordinary and the only way this
12776.40s: business can move forward is if we clear
12778.36s: the
12779.56s: air first of all who runs the restaurant
12782.76s: who's in charge of the restaurant
12785.28s: really by default it seems that I am I

12810.00s: the one big reason you don't trust

13075.08s: book you wrote a book yeah gentle Satan
13078.56s: it was about my father that's what my
13080.16s: mother called him I stayed up to 4:00
13082.76s: this morning because it almost like I
13085.12s: was living it live yet I was seeing a
13087.52s: reenact of the same
13089.01s: [Music]
13090.36s: scenario I mean let me read you a few uh
13093.96s: extracts
13095.72s: he hated being called out on his
13097.60s: behavior especially by his
13100.68s: son yeah I was caught in a tug of war
13104.68s: between my mother and father does this
13107.88s: sound familiar yes he didn't listen to
13111.56s: anyone else's opinion and he did as he
13115.00s: chose in his business
13117.40s: ventures come
13119.40s: on the way you describe your father it's
13123.52s: exactly the way Daniel would describe
13126.16s: you and I'm sorry to tell you this but
13128.64s: you've got to listen it's it's a sequel
13131.92s: but it's live and it's going on in these
13133.64s: four walls yes it
13136.68s: is like father like
13140.68s: son I see exactly what Chef Ramsey has
13144.16s: brought up I mean it I was wrong it's
13149.04s: irrelevant of everything
13151.20s: else but I apologize to both of you
13155.60s: with all of my heart I have done the
13158.96s: wrong thing if we can't get together we
13162.56s: might as well just close the door
13164.24s: [Music]
13167.76s: now that's the smartest thing you've
13169.56s: said since I've been through these doors
13171.20s: we need to draw a line of the sand
13173.16s: forgive and forget and move forward and
13175.64s: that's exactly what Daniel's asked you
13177.28s: to do I will do my best forget the
13180.68s: business the most important thing in
13182.60s: life is family now make maybe we can
13185.80s: begin yet and moving forward and focus
13188.44s: on the restaurant
13191.08s: okay thank you thank you thank you thank
13195.04s: you it's hard for a father to do that to

15834.32s: ignoring each
15836.40s: other well when Aris went to college he
15840.48s: never really wanted to be here and most
15842.84s: of the time he wouldn't be here at all

15847.92s: forth and uh when he graduated from
15851.68s: college we had his party here but we had
15854.76s: I mean the place was full we had 100
15856.68s: people here or so and when he was doing
15859.68s: his little speech and thanking people
15861.60s: for coming and everything you know he
15864.72s: announced I'm going to make something of
15866.96s: my life I'm not working in the
15869.44s: restaurant what in front of all the
15871.36s: staff in front of all of his

15930.32s: something of my life I'm not working in
15933.20s: the restaurant
15934.72s: what and now Mike and Aris arrive at the
15937.32s: restaurant unaware of what he has just
15939.56s: uncovered pull a chair up both you sit
15941.68s: down
15942.84s: I want to tell you something really
15944.20s: important I'm [ __ ] off with you and
15947.00s: I'll tell you why I don't think that
15948.84s: you've quite understood the level of
15951.44s: support that you've had in and out of
15954.88s: here and so when you turn around and
15958.00s: told all your friends in your parents'
15961.28s: restaurant that you're going to make
15962.40s: something out of yourself almost in a
15963.76s: way that you were disgusted with being
15965.96s: brought up in a restaurant and this
15967.88s: wasn't you you were above that well it
15970.64s: wasn't me being above it it was just I
15972.44s: didn't know if it at it was the way you
15973.80s: declared it wasn't good enough for you
15975.20s: well this was before I know yes but you
15977.96s: did it and you shat on your own doorstep
15980.84s: I wasn't [ __ ] on that I I love my
15982.76s: family more than anything I'm tell you
15983.76s: you did well I was I was confused at the
15986.76s: time too I didn't know what I was going
15987.76s: to do with my life I went to college I
15989.64s: didn't know if the restaurant business
15990.96s: was something I was going to do and I
15991.92s: didn't know if I was ready to do it but
15993.40s: I don't think you've ever understood the
15994.96s: ramifications of a announcement like
15997.48s: that how did you feel truthfully about
16000.04s: that statement truthfully my son when I
16002.60s: say something like that it hurts me yes
16004.68s: thank
16005.72s: you I mean I I'm not a perfect human
16008.40s: being look at me no I'm just saying I'm
16009.84s: not no no if you've got anything to say
16012.04s: I'd say it to your mom and
16013.44s: dad take the opportunity you give a
16015.80s: little bit of
16019.76s: privacy
16022.09s: [Music]
16027.32s: I I just see how we struggled as a
16030.00s: family regardless if we're making M or
16031.56s: not we we kill ourselves here and I
16033.92s: didn't want to kill myself either not in
16035.28s: a selfish way I just didn't want to I
16037.08s: don't but I guess I remember it because
16040.80s: it really hurt me when you said it I
16043.20s: remember it and I don't think it's
16044.84s: anything that we've ever talked about
16046.44s: and I sincerely apologize for saying
16048.08s: that cuz that was so wrong with
16050.76s: me Mom Dad I'm
16056.52s: sorry love you love you too I think
16059.72s: Mikey hasn't really taken era seriously
16062.72s: because he's never really gotten himself
16064.68s: committed but that has changed and for
16067.64s: him to make this declaration with such
16070.40s: passion he's definitely committed I 100%
16073.68s: believe that everything's going to
16075.68s: [Music]
16084.92s: work after Aris cleared the air with his
16087.40s: parents Chef Ramsey is still concerned
16089.80s: about his commitment okay so I've been
16092.60s: doing some thinking why have you hung
16094.76s: around so long it's it's my family it's
16097.04s: I I don't we don't give up on a family
16098.72s: and this is my my home too so I love
16101.08s: this place and I want to fix it but I
16102.96s: don't know if you're committed enough
16104.32s: that's all cuz it's not about dancing on
16106.44s: the dance floor no I know but if you put
16108.48s: that determination that you put on that
16110.12s: [ __ ] dance hall last night carrying
16111.92s: all those [ __ ] tables in your mouth
16114.08s: in a kitchen trust me you'd be
16116.00s: Untouchable here that's what I want I
16117.92s: know at one point I wouldn't believed in
16119.56s: me either I've changed I know I can do
16121.76s: this I just need support and I just need
16123.60s: my dad to help me so you say you're
16127.40s: committed I am committed yes and you say
16129.92s: that you're committed yes yes so put
16133.96s: both your hands
16135.72s: together let go hands out
16140.08s: now oh [ __ ] y even if I'm right handing

18317.56s: was
18318.92s: overboard You Got Your Name In Lights

18377.24s: dare you I'm the ha manager I would had
18379.56s: you fired in 2
18381.04s: minutes the bottom line is you don't
18383.92s: want
18386.56s: it joke you're
18392.04s: right it is clear that Natalie's lack of
18394.72s: leadership has resulted in a frustrated
18397.48s: and ineffective staff good morning to
18401.00s: get through to her Gordon has asked the
18402.72s: family to stay in the office so they can
18404.84s: observe a staff meeting by way of the
18407.00s: surveillance cameras that was a crazy 24
18409.20s: hours right yes so for me I want to find
18413.48s: out what the issues
18414.68s: are there the kitchen lacking a leader
18418.44s: like that's where all our problems come
18419.84s: in so that's why they all act like it
18421.52s: sure but I mean who decides who's
18422.84s: working where in the kitchen who does
18424.40s: the time to fall in the place you do
18426.16s: your own yeah come in what the save the
18429.64s: ation and get through the night when we
18431.04s: come in I ask you where you want to work
18432.60s: at seriously seriously okay why do they
18435.48s: keep switching people around if we know
18436.88s: Kino is the strongest in the middle why
18438.76s: on Fridays and Saturday night Kino is in
18440.52s: the damn back prepping food it makes no
18442.20s: sense to me that's we're going to suffer
18444.08s: why is that if you not going to work
18446.12s: where we need you how are we going to
18447.44s: get stuff done thing is in the key word
18449.36s: it's not consistent this is my thing to
18451.12s: y'all we get well we don't have this
18453.12s: once we've gotten to a table and rung a
18454.80s: table in oh didn't we tell y'all we
18456.48s: don't have it that is not the most
18458.44s: that's like d half the time we tell
18460.68s: y'all time y don't listen what you want
18463.32s: me to show you the empty bucket no I
18464.68s: don't want you to show me an empty
18465.80s: bucket I didn't say that it was all on
18467.52s: you it's a two-way street but guess what
18470.08s: the customer still
18471.92s: suck everything's just run down window
18474.32s: pretty much everybody just do what they
18475.40s: going to do everybody's going at each
18477.24s: other cuz it's it's just you know no one
18478.96s: running thing so everything is just
18481.04s: hostile if we had a leader in that
18483.92s: kitchen this place I honestly believe
18486.24s: would be like night and day but we need
18488.20s: that direction are we not gaining
18490.68s: direction from
18493.84s: Natalie Natalie doesn't step up to the
18496.40s: plate as she should it's so aggravating
18499.36s: this is your establishment I mean come
18502.12s: on bottom line a ship ain't going to
18504.28s: move without a captain that's it got to
18505.96s: have some leadership period it's so

21960.72s: realize his food's just not working and
21962.64s: that he needs to do something else
21966.48s: my cooking it's something that's a
21967.76s: little more evolving different here try
21969.92s: it I like to just kind of take stuff
21972.00s: that's basic and just sort of reinvent
21973.88s: it yeah you can't s that damn wow it's
21978.52s: weird if I wouldn't get it again did not
21980.76s: like the taste they said it wasn't good
21982.72s: poor ha definitely thinks his food is
21984.56s: like Olympic quality food it's perfect
21987.08s: just like having a friend that just
21988.52s: thinks they're completely kick ass at
21990.32s: something and they're not that good at
21991.76s: it he could either order Seafood but I
21993.28s: would not cook another steak for him
21996.20s: all right how your tables doing Drew 45
21998.24s: their order's been in for an hour they
21999.76s: got that little girl looking like she's

22004.56s: die when the heat is on in the kitchen
22007.24s: I've never worked this hard
22009.84s: before Richard serves no purpose how's
22012.88s: it going not good I know he doesn't know
22015.96s: anything about the restaurant to help my
22018.84s: job is run the front of the house okay
22020.28s: and that's the easy part oh my god I
22022.40s: didn't even see you Cass how you doing
22024.24s: baby I just dress up and smile that's
22026.96s: all I do
22029.20s: voila he always has a smile on his face
22032.72s: like nothing is going wrong he kind of
22034.16s: has this but there's some deep-seated
22036.64s: issues with the restaurant and the
22039.52s: community we put a tent up in the
22042.48s: parking lot I didn't know he needed to
22044.12s: permit and then we were pouring Li
22046.12s: without the license a newscaster came
22049.20s: into the restaurant and he told me that
22050.92s: the neighbors don't like us being here
22053.76s: they could do better and deserve better
22056.04s: and my response was they don't like us
22058.04s: cuz we're a black own restaurant
22059.16s: andwhere in a white
22062.48s: neighborhood since Rich called the
22064.40s: neighborhood raises we lost most of the
22066.92s: business what's going on out there uh
22069.44s: you don't want to know man it was so bad
22071.52s: I I didn't I couldn't even walk the
22072.76s: floor I don't have a plan B for
22075.20s: this this is my life
22082.79s: [Music]
22087.52s: to be a successful restaurant you need
22089.24s: the neighborhood on your side now I did
22090.92s: a little research on Parks before I got
22092.56s: here and what I found was somewhat
22094.08s: shocking they've only been open for 3
22096.00s: years and they've managed already to
22097.92s: totally alienate the whole
22101.76s: neighborhood hello hey good afternoon

22105.12s: co-owner of the restaurant co- owner of

22107.56s: Dapper we need Chef Ramsey help because
22110.20s: or and I have built up a ill

23272.08s: here well I don't know about anybody
23273.88s: else but I feel like Richard just is
23276.32s: really reluctant to be interactive with
23278.64s: the guest after they're sat it's like
23280.44s: butts and seats and that's where he
23282.76s: stops
23284.48s: and we're really responsible of solving
23287.04s: gas problems Richard when he gets
23289.52s: dressed he drinks wine and so sometimes
23292.16s: it makes it hard for us to communicate
23294.08s: with him when we're having
23296.20s: problems cuz he's been drinking all day
23299.16s: if he wants to be as effective as an
23301.36s: owner he needs to be completely 100%
23303.68s: he's here that's a good point it's a
23306.28s: very good point and does he drink every
23307.72s: day

23312.84s: they have a lot of separation
23314.60s: Jorge's in the kitchen and Richard's out
23316.20s: front their interactions are pretty Min
23318.52s: minimal they need to educate themselves

23323.32s: about running a restaurant than either
23324.88s: one of them
23325.92s: together they're too proud to say hey I

26941.28s: we put a tent up in the parking lot I
26944.20s: didn't know you needed to permit and

27554.84s: food problems at Park's Edge um let's
27557.40s: catch up he now wants to delve deeper
27559.68s: into the issues that this restaurant has
27561.84s: with its local community I'd like to
27564.56s: sort of understand what happened here
27567.40s: with the neighborhood uh number one was
27569.48s: because we erected a tent in our parking
27571.60s: lot without a proper permit so we get
27574.00s: cited first neighbors came by and say
27576.12s: hey you got to take the tent down it's
27577.28s: not legal did you take it down we did in
27580.16s: accordance to the city but not in
27581.56s: accordance to the neighbors damn so that
27584.36s: off the local next right so then we
27586.60s: didn't have a liquor license and a
27588.80s: business license and I'm not going to
27590.96s: lie we were we were we were negligent
27593.00s: wow I mean that's quite major no liquor
27594.48s: license yeah holy [ __ ] yeah really yeah
27597.72s: so then verus neighbors came out and
27600.20s: said the neighborhood could do better uh
27602.40s: we were not good enough for the
27603.60s: neighborhood and my response was they
27605.80s: don't like us because we are a minority
27607.72s: owned restaurant in a white
27610.40s: neighborhood wow yeah so you said the
27613.04s: neighborhood was racist yes exactly have

28168.32s: in here
28173.84s: well I don't know about anybody else but
28175.04s: I feel like Richard just is really
28177.32s: reluctant to be interactive with a
28179.56s: guests after they're sat it's like butts
28181.48s: and seats and that's where he
28184.28s: stops and we're really responsible of
28187.44s: solving guest problems Richard when he
28190.12s: gets dressed he drinks wine and so
28192.60s: sometimes it makes it hard for us to
28194.32s: communicate with him when we're having
28196.96s: problems cuz he's been drinking all day
28199.96s: if he wants to be as effective as an
28202.16s: owner he needs to be completely 100%
28204.48s: he's here that's good point it's a very
28207.24s: good point and does he drink every day
28211.24s: yes and what does haai think of that
28213.64s: they have a lot of Separation Jorge's in
28215.96s: the kitchen and Richard's out front
28217.24s: their interactions are pretty minim
28219.28s: minimal they need to educate themselves
28221.80s: on more about this business I know more
28224.12s: about running a restaurant than either
28225.64s: one of them
28226.68s: together they're too proud to to say hey
28230.04s: I do need help yeah Chef Jorge he acts
28233.20s: like he's like on your level he's like
28235.60s: fresh out of culinary school I mean the
28238.16s: ink hasn't even dried on his little
28239.60s: certificate and now he thinks he's an
28241.72s: executive
28244.00s: chef has anyone ever told H that his
28246.48s: food is so complicated Chef is extremely
28249.48s: stubborn does not care what anybody has

30553.00s: decaying relationship of Greg and Mary
30555.96s: and Chef Ramsey has a plan to do just
30558.44s: that morning Greg good morning chef how
30560.56s: are you yeah well thank you um yesterday
30562.88s: was a huge eye opener and I've got one
30565.84s: very very important question to ask you
30568.52s: do you feel let down yeah truthfully I
30572.40s: feel a little bit let down because I
30574.44s: don't feel that I'm getting the moral
30576.28s: support you know I'm trying to do
30578.36s: something for them and I don't think
30579.44s: that they see that I'm doing it for them
30580.88s: I think that they think that I'm doing
30581.92s: it for me I don't think they quite fully
30585.12s: have digested what happens if it does
30587.16s: close they've all told me why don't you
30589.00s: just close it and I said you don't
30590.72s: understand what the ramifications of
30591.92s: that are we lose everything I mean
30594.12s: everything we lose okay come with me I
30596.60s: want to show you something I want you to
30598.96s: watch something I can't want you to sit
30600.92s: down um watch this program I think
30603.12s: you're going to find it quite
30604.32s: interesting with Greg watching closely
30606.76s: on the monitor H how are you how are you
30609.56s: hello Chef Ramsey has arranged for a
30611.76s: chat with Mary and her daughters Gabby
30614.40s: and Anna uh I spent some time with Greg
30618.20s: last night before we left and I I saw a
30620.68s: lot of frustrations a lot of pressure do
30623.08s: you see how desperate he is can you read
30625.32s: that or it's hard to read we know that
30627.80s: he's struggling but he just doesn't
30629.68s: speak out so it's kind of hard for us to
30631.80s: get it out of him yeah it's just the
30633.04s: something that you see as a Outsider so
30635.64s: he shuts down yeah how long's that been
30638.24s: like that I say ever since like pretty
30640.80s: much the restaurant started I always say
30642.40s: I'm like I felt like my parents were
30644.04s: much happier before they own their own
30645.80s: business they would go out have fun
30649.16s: exactly and right now he's just living I
30651.68s: mean surviving right do you think he's
30653.72s: happy no the way I I see him the
30656.60s: restaurant's sucking so much life out of
30658.32s: him and we try to get him to break out a
30660.20s: little bit but he just refuses to he is
30662.64s: just so stubborn like he just will not
30664.48s: leave Soo I don't think he
30666.68s: can he's such a oneman band he does
30669.68s: everything and anything what you do if
30672.20s: you fell ill what would you all do I
30674.24s: continue running the business I
30676.16s: personally don't think you can I'm sorry
30678.52s: oh really I don't feel afraid but how
30681.08s: are you going to do it Mary how would it
30683.04s: work I for me I put in one really chair
30686.76s: behind the key we haven't got money for
30688.44s: salaries if he stops this business would
30692.48s: close I don't think you realize what
30694.76s: he's doing for all of you everything he
30698.08s: does is to keep a roof above your heads
30701.44s: not because he loves doing it and I
30703.36s: don't think he feels that he has the
30705.40s: emotional support that's what's eating
30707.72s: him
30708.60s: away I think that one of you can do a
30711.00s: bit more Mary are you willing to support
30714.04s: him do you think deep down is you could
30716.32s: do more in here yes I can why because I
30722.44s: need thinking of myself too he cannot do
30725.88s: it alone yeah but really I don't want to
30728.52s: do it something I don't like it let me
30730.36s: put it this way Mary both of you wanted
30732.04s: this dream you encouraged them this is
30734.56s: your responsibility whether you like it
30736.60s: or not right now you're only here 3 days
30738.80s: a week and when you talk to him it's not
30741.64s: done in a constructive manner you nag
30743.40s: him you can't lay into him like that is
30746.00s: your
30749.36s: husband when you guys met you were

30789.92s: only here 3 days a week and when you
30792.60s: talk to him and you nag him you can't

35898.08s: back and let everybody do what they do
35900.36s: so well and I can only say
35904.96s: that this is the beginning of a new
35908.32s: day she seems sincere now but I'm a
35911.96s: little doubtful about
35913.60s: what she's going to do as far as
35916.32s: changing very doubtful in the way sad to
35921.47s: [Music]
35925.88s: say now that Denise has recognized the
35928.44s: morale problems of her restaurant
35930.88s: Hi l Chef Ramsey knows that he needs her
35933.20s: to fully understand why the community
35936.12s: continues to be upset with her I put
35938.52s: together a select group of people that
35941.84s: I'd like you to hear from okay okay
35945.00s: please jump in the car headsets on
35946.84s: listen carefully and I'll come back oh
35949.76s: my God these people they're going to
35951.16s: crucify me I'm going to be thrown to the
35954.12s: walls now there's be some issues and
35956.88s: some turmoil and I would like to take
35959.68s: this moment moment for you to help me to
35964.12s: understand why Cathy hun and its owner
35968.56s: Denise have angered this
35972.12s: community who would like to go first
35974.80s: what she really tried to do was
35976.64s: appropriate an identity it's like going
35979.12s: to Australia and trademarking mate or
35982.60s: y'all in the
35984.68s: South she's acting like a bully why is
35987.44s: she a bully anybody who would like to
35989.28s: use the word
35990.72s: is at risk of receiving a ceas and
35993.48s: assist order uh from her lawyers that
35996.08s: says change your name or else and I have
35999.04s: a website called Welcome to Baltimore
36001.08s: hun can I see assist letter that she
36004.68s: sent wow I mean that's pretty severe
36007.60s: transcends the restaurant industry she
36010.40s: had gone to the Maryland Transit
36012.20s: Administration for their hun ad campaign
36015.24s: and forced them to give her creative
36017.96s: control basically the Maryland state
36020.44s: government has to go to Denise Whiting
36022.56s: for her
36023.64s: approval do you remember what that
36026.88s: legally she has the standing but she's
36028.56s: not in the right and that's what people
36030.52s: recognize it's just about money for her
36032.60s: it's not about hamon it's not about
36034.32s: anything it's just money she pushes
36036.64s: everyone around she's focused on Denise
36039.24s: Whiting and if you don't like it you're
36041.92s: going to be sorry I have seen her nasty
36046.04s: she's made a mockery of who we are and
36048.56s: then tried to profit from and I think
36050.48s: that's very egregious the damage is done
36052.76s: all the citizens of Baltimore were the
36054.44s: ones that stopped going they are not
36056.72s: going to go use that restaurant no way
36060.72s: ever what would it take for this
36064.08s: community to embrace Cafe hun again she
36067.88s: has to walk away from the tra trademark
36069.48s: she has to abandon it all claim to it
36072.40s: say it was a mistake she does not own it
36074.48s: it doesn't belong to anybody right I'm
36077.64s: very grateful for your Insight thank you

36093.36s: so angry at all the things that were
36096.48s: happening and didn't know how to handle

36101.24s: how was hard in there there's so much
36103.68s: hate
36105.28s: directed in in my direction there was no
36107.80s: you did go after a few people you did
36109.44s: send letters where they were absolutely
36111.72s: freaking out to sort of stand up against
36114.56s: but when you threaten people or they
36116.72s: feel threatened they're going to revolt
36119.60s: do you realize you've made a mistake yes
36121.72s: you have to do something you have to
36123.92s: take responsibility and make a gesture

36141.68s: disaster in the last several months and
36144.36s: I'm the only one that can change that

39898.68s: all the fat comes out twice as fast it

39903.84s: disgusting the kinita PE it's dry the
39908.60s: cactus

39987.24s: can't let me finish let me finish you

40273.32s: didn't see any support there tonight I'm
40275.00s: sorry I mean I it's a big difference
40276.56s: between nagging and being

40309.72s: I I [ __ ] need you in here whether you
40311.80s: like it or not and if I didn't know the
40314.76s: background watching the way you two Lea
40317.56s: with each other I'd never believe that
40319.04s: was husband and wife ever we don't act
40321.40s: like husband and wife anymore it's it's
40323.68s: just too dangerous buddy it's just it's
40326.44s: it's so fragile in here it's all built
40329.24s: around just you and between you and I do
40331.24s: you think that's healthy no I don't
40332.88s: think that's healthy come on

40337.64s: let them down you can't do it on your
40340.24s: own there has to be a way there has to
40342.92s: be a way I can't let it fail I mean I
40346.28s: just
40348.70s: [Music]
40351.68s: can't without question zoko has a lot of
40355.12s: issues but the one issue that needs to
40357.16s: be dealt with immediately is the
40359.24s: decaying relationship of Greg and Mary
40362.12s: and Chef Ramsey has a plan to do just
40364.64s: that morning Greg good morning chef how
40366.76s: are you yeah well thank you um yesterday
40369.04s: was a huge eye opener and I've got one
40372.20s: very important question to ask you do
40374.88s: you feel let down yeah truthfully I feel
40378.80s: a little bit let down because I don't
40380.76s: feel that I'm getting the moral support
40383.32s: you know I'm trying to do something for
40384.96s: them and I don't think that they see
40386.12s: that I'm doing it for them I think that
40387.44s: they think that I'm doing it for me but
40389.24s: I don't think they quite fully have
40391.56s: digested what happens if it does close
40394.08s: they've all told me well should just
40395.36s: close it and I said you don't understand
40397.04s: what the ramifications of that are we
40399.00s: lose everything I mean everything we
40400.88s: lose okay come with me I show you
40403.76s: something I want you to watch something
40405.56s: I can't want you to sit
40407.12s: down um watch this program I think
40409.32s: you're going to find it quite
40410.52s: interesting with Greg watching closely
40412.96s: on the monitor H how are you I'm how are
40415.56s: you hello Chef Ramsey has arranged for a
40418.00s: chat with Mary and her daughters Gabby
40420.64s: and Anna uh I spent some time with Greg
40424.40s: last night before we left and i i s a
40426.92s: lot of frustrations a lot of pressure do
40429.28s: you see how desperate he is can you read
40431.52s: that or it's hard to read we know that
40434.04s: he's struggling but he just doesn't
40435.92s: speak out so it's kind of hard for us to
40438.00s: get it out of him yeah it's just
40439.28s: something that you see as a Outsider so
40441.84s: he shuts down yeah how long's that been
40444.44s: like that I say ever since like pretty
40447.00s: much the restaurant started I always say
40448.64s: I'm like I felt like my parents were
40450.28s: much happier before they owned their own
40452.00s: business they would go out have fun
40455.36s: exactly and right now he's just living I
40457.92s: mean surviving right do you think he's
40459.96s: happy no the way I see him the
40462.80s: restaurant sucking so much life out of
40464.52s: him and we try to get him to break out a
40466.44s: little bit but he just refuses to he is
40468.88s: just so stubborn like he just will not
40470.68s: leave so I don't think he can he's such
40474.36s: a oneman band he does everything and
40476.80s: anything what would you do if you fell
40478.72s: ill what would you all do I continue
40480.92s: running the business I personally don't

40485.80s: I don't feel afraid but how are you
40487.44s: going to do it Mary how would it work I
40489.88s: for me I put in one really Chef behind
40493.24s: the key we haven't got money for
40494.64s: salaries if he stops this business would
40498.64s: close I don't think you realize what
40500.96s: he's doing for all of you everything he
40504.28s: does is to keep a roof above your heads
40507.64s: but because he loves doing it and I
40509.56s: don't think he feels that he has the
40511.56s: emotional support that's what's eating
40513.92s: him away
40515.80s: I think that one of you can do a bit
40517.40s: more Mary are you willing to support him
40521.12s: do you think deep down inside you could
40522.48s: do more in here yes I can why because I
40528.64s: need thinking of myself too he cannot do
40532.08s: it alone yeah but really I don't want to
40534.68s: do it something I don't like it let me
40536.52s: put it this way Mary both of you wanted
40538.20s: this dream yeah you encouraged them this
