1942.28s: still think it's good how are you going
1943.72s: to get it to be medium Weir that's the
1945.44s: question I mean why is it such a defense

3286.56s: sorry I'm going home thank God and
3288.96s: server Sarah doesn't exactly like what

3293.36s: praise the
3295.32s: Lord what do we do about Sarah the
3297.72s: problem with Sarah is that you've left
3299.16s: yourselves open because of the lack of
3301.20s: Direction that's been shown to the team
3303.28s: and the fact that she's a good waitress
3304.44s: she's got over a barrel she's got the RS
3307.68s: you've got to take control how you can't
3310.20s: be beholden to one member of Staff one
3313.52s: Chef in the kitchen the staff are
3315.68s: dictating for convenience and that is so
3319.04s: wrong I'm to blame for that that this is
3322.00s: my fault I'm not single-handed we both
3323.96s: BL you're absolutely right you both are
3325.44s: I am how can you expect them to take
3327.72s: example because it it it it starts from
3330.08s: the top correct and a fish rots from the
3332.00s: head downwards as owners you set the
3334.40s: rules and anyone that doesn't coincide
3337.80s: with your rules they're out I feel like
3341.68s: this has really set a fire in me no more
3344.12s: drinking for me no more smoking for you
3346.00s: all right I want to leave by example and
3348.44s: really start working to make this place

3354.28s: bar and you all follow it okay okay I
3357.88s: want control back I'm taking it today
3360.16s: I'm taking control back today there's
3362.56s: only one voice and that's the voice of
3364.92s: the owners so what they say gets done
3367.96s: period I I I realized I was wrong and
3370.24s: I'm wrong I'll do my best to not be
3373.04s: anymore because it's wrong I want to
3374.52s: improve myself on these little things

4908.72s: came here from Italy and they took over
4910.64s: this pizzer in 1970 and at the age of 14

4938.88s: and Mama Maria his father passed away
4941.56s: his mom passed away he was the only one

9964.00s: had potential it was you know kind of we
9965.64s: want to give it our Vibe and take a shot
9967.16s: at our dream what was it like when you
9968.88s: opened it was fantastic both did front
9971.60s: of the house and we flocked in what

9982.16s: when oh my God where is everybody the
9985.16s: business been crippled and now we don't

9990.40s: always been front of the house while I
9992.04s: was focusing on that the front of the
9993.68s: house really took a beating where was
9995.00s: Lisa at this point she was backing off

9997.84s: of the house for a while and that's

11304.04s: your response was I don't know there's
11307.56s: one thing I've got to emphasize is that

12568.84s: runs the
12570.04s: restaurant yes but I mean even after 6
12573.84s: years you'd think that you've got up to
12575.24s: speed in terms of trying to run this

12588.32s: Parts my hands are tied just he's having
12590.56s: a hard time backing down wow because he
12593.36s: let it slip that you weren't that
12595.08s: passionate about running this oh I think

12619.12s: he says I'm stubborn because I have
12621.92s: different ideas and I have different
12623.36s: views but he has taken away a lot of my
12626.04s: desire to do things and the the
12629.00s: willingness and the drive that I had
12630.48s: when we first came in here because um I
12632.80s: am held back you know I'm stuck that's
12635.36s: frustrating right but there seems to be

13711.36s: explain to Tom how his precooking is
13713.56s: having a negative impact on the food
13715.92s: fresh food doesn't smell taste [ __ ]

13732.76s: honestly think that your customers would
13734.36s: be happy to pay for Frozen ship being
13736.68s: defrosted rapidly they are under the
13739.40s: impression in your [ __ ] dying room
13741.92s: that what you're cooking them is fresh
13743.92s: so you're not going to convince me that
13745.68s: this is better than serving it fresh why
13748.80s: I've just said does that make any sense
13750.64s: it does it does thank God you're not as

13794.52s: Life he's got to stop trying to convince
13796.40s: me of these ridiculous practices and
13798.28s: every time he doesn't see that they're
13800.36s: wrong I want this business but I want it
13802.88s: I want it to function correctly and my
13805.28s: fear is that by the time it comes to me

13847.52s: digestive issues the fish and my
13850.32s: vegetables were total mush it's dated

13862.76s: to the old Hitching Post for a showdown
13865.36s: with Tom and his staff hello everybody
13868.28s: hello hello Sil Ramsey first of all the
13871.16s: one thing that I learned since I've been
13873.68s: here is that there are a lot of bad
13876.68s: practices taking place yesterday was
13879.28s: very upsetting right this morning I went
13882.92s: live to a local radio station all of a
13886.64s: sudden the phone lines start going crazy
13888.92s: lines are jammed these complaints
13891.88s: started coming in let me tell you
13893.76s: something really
13894.92s: important the reason why we're in this
13896.80s: situation Tom is because this whole
13899.16s: business is run on your system why are
13902.76s: you so controlling Tom it wasn't
13905.44s: controlling typee of thing it was just a
13908.56s: routine not as far as I'm concerned Tom
13911.60s: runs a business his way and he's not
13914.68s: open to alternative ideas so Tom makes a
13917.00s: decision everyone's got to go with it
13919.24s: and have a percentage of decisions how
13921.92s: many of them are right I think it's
13923.92s: 50/50 on some of the items wow Tom let
13928.48s: me tell you you do not want to pass a
13930.64s: liability to your daughter exactly so
13933.36s: you have a duty now now to step up and
13935.80s: do something you haven't done in 7 years
13938.12s: and that's

13945.76s: way out and you just hoping for a better
13948.88s: day but I'm always a Believer for better
13952.12s: day better business to do changes at any
13954.72s: time okay I'm hoping that my father's

13960.40s: change we have to change immediately and
13964.24s: I trust you mhm I need your help let's

18757.52s: bit of schedule thing where we're not

18824.92s: that every day someone have to be here
18827.80s: but it's driving them apart you have to
18831.56s: understand when the time comes we all
18833.52s: have to do our own

20584.92s: convincing yourself that everything's
20586.44s: fine
20589.20s: what you have proven to me is that you
20591.64s: are not in a position to take
20594.08s: responsibility for anything except
20597.68s: cleaning for the first 40 minutes of
20599.92s: meeting you all you told me about was
20601.56s: the cleaning your in denial you're

20706.40s: restaurant Nino and the food but he's
20709.52s: about to learn a whole lot more as he

20824.44s: consistent okay where's Nino

20853.56s: situation okay so Nino just continually
20856.28s: stands there

20991.40s: it to somebody no but what trying to say

21256.52s: out and do it I cannot put any more
21259.16s: money in this place I'm willing to fight
21261.80s: to keep this restaurant open do you have
21264.32s: some suggestion how we can do that we
21267.60s: have an expert in the restaurant
21268.80s: business we can ask him you really want
21271.08s: to do it yes
21273.76s: absolutely hey chef Ramsey hi how you
21278.36s: doing so 54 years in the making mhm and

21287.88s: understand what that means yes I do Chef
21289.40s: it's got to come from you Nino I'm
21291.52s: willing to commit take control Nino I
21294.60s: shall no more excuses just be on top of
21297.92s: everything I'm willly mom the business
21300.84s: is going to have to become a new
21301.96s: priority number one number one at this
21305.80s: point I I believe Nino really wants to
21308.28s: turn his life around and he wants to do
21311.00s: what's best for the restaurant and the
21315.88s: [Music]
21317.40s: family well Nino says he's committed to
21319.72s: change how don't jef Ramsey feels it's
21322.28s: important that he shares this news with
21324.24s: his brother and his sister
21327.92s: okay the lack of commitment with Nino
21331.16s: has been going on for far too long and
21333.72s: your mother stepped up and told him I've
21336.04s: had enough and Nino to his credit turned
21338.92s: around and said Mom I want to do this
21342.12s: I'm
21343.12s: committed
21344.96s: yes I don't believe
21349.00s: that n know you've been in denial for a
21351.48s: long time what your responsibilities
21353.04s: have been you made so many promises to
21355.36s: all of us over your life and this time
21357.12s: you need to be in
21358.76s: charge he's commited to that this
21360.72s: morning and this is the new Nino maybe
21362.52s: for 3 4 weeks but then he'll revert back
21364.84s: to the old Nino
21369.56s: I I'm asking let's get out of the past
21372.64s: what is it we can do from this point to
21374.12s: move forward and treat each other with
21375.64s: decency and walk away shaking each
21377.68s: other's
21381.88s: hands okay no more excuses no more
21384.60s: denial I need you to be the big brother

22072.40s: fine dining restaurant who you think
22074.20s: you're talking to this is the finest of
22076.36s: the finest what he tells us every day is
22078.92s: he is the best [ __ ] restaurant from
22082.08s: New York to LA I would put this
22084.40s: restaurant up against any
22086.24s: because the passion really we are

22091.44s: gross I don't know isn't that

22103.80s: and local we really are from Farm to
22106.84s: Fork that's why our food is the best by
22112.20s: far he's always playing up the quality
22114.40s: of the food we made that sauce from
22116.36s: Scrat and I know most of our stuff is
22119.96s: frozen there are Corners that are cut

22144.44s: customers get ice cool it down he talks
22147.32s: down to people is there enough bread for

22178.92s: stare at us Joe doesn't realize his
22181.56s: actions affect our livelihood what is
22184.20s: this that one the owner was very
22187.04s: condescending the owner was rude
22189.20s: business is super slow and the big
22191.48s: reason people don't come in is because
22192.96s: of Joe I never had a piece of meat come
22195.44s: back in here in 10 years he's the one
22198.40s: who needs to change his way of thinking

24694.48s: we're in this group I got blinders on
24697.52s: but I do want to make it better I want

24704.44s: restaurant for everybody not just Joe
24707.00s: Nei for these people in here that stuck

24718.16s: sincere and the most honest I've heard
24719.76s: since I've been here [ __ ] day
24723.20s: tomorrow we start a fresh day I'm going
24726.12s: to do that Chef we draw a line in the
24728.20s: stand let's draw a line in the
24731.76s: sand good night good
24736.48s: night with Joe finally admitting to Chef
24739.28s: Ramsey that he has lost sight of some of
24741.16s: the problems take a seat I want me to
24743.20s: watch something Chef Ramsey Begins the
24745.48s: day with a plan to show this owner some
24747.84s: of the issues he doesn't even realize he
24749.92s: has tough day yesterday that was a uh a
24753.28s: hard one yeah and I wanted to talk to
24756.72s: you guys without Joe around because I
24759.32s: need to hear the good the bad the ugly
24763.72s: and I'm not talking about skinny the
24767.20s: goat uh who's your
24773.44s: starts there's no formalities here this
24775.68s: is wide
24778.52s: open you shouldn't be scared of Joe
24784.80s: cuz I've got your
24787.40s: back help
24789.60s: me iy I think Joe is at fault for the
24794.28s: lack of
24796.08s: business because of the way he berates
24799.44s: the staff in front of the customers uh
24802.64s: it turns people off and turns people
24805.36s: away he needs to control his temper he
24808.68s: was cussing at me right here in front of
24810.28s: the door and then dragged me into the
24811.48s: kitchen and started screaming at me even
24812.84s: louder so I might as well been sitting
24815.00s: right out here and I mean everybody
24817.08s: witnessed it and my table was so
24818.68s: disgusted they just wanted their check
24819.96s: to
24821.52s: leave and they left me a note you know
24824.36s: telling me to keep my chin up and that I
24825.76s: did a great job and everything I was
24827.08s: supposed to do and I had left that note
24829.32s: to Joe and he would tell me don't let
24831.64s: that get to your head when people tell
24832.96s: you you're doing great cuz there's
24834.64s: always mistakes being made it was to the
24836.68s: point where I ended up having to go into
24839.52s: the back because I started crying and I
24841.84s: didn't you know I just didn't want to be
24843.92s: like I don't know I mean and we have Joe
24845.84s: constantly saying well you're doing this
24847.72s: wrong you're doing this wrong we all get
24849.16s: flustered and you
24851.24s: know and
24853.88s: I I let it get to me yeah Kaye that's
24858.76s: terrible it
24860.52s: is moving forward why does he think his
24863.16s: food is good that's my main thing
24865.20s: because there's stuff that's been
24866.48s: questionable and he's like oh that's
24868.04s: that's okay know that's okay we can
24869.56s: serve that and I just wanted to say no
24871.16s: we can't serve that but in his mind it's
24873.96s: okay how'd you rate the food out of 10
24876.24s: two of being
24878.20s: generous he loves to hear the praise but
24880.72s: he will certainly go up against anybody
24882.64s: that has anything negative to say the
24884.92s: guy that was sitting there across from
24886.24s: you while you were having lunch he said
24887.44s: he would send it back but he doesn't
24888.68s: want to listen to Joe yell at him if
24890.24s: they see Joe's vehicle outside they'll
24892.68s: go somewhere else because they don't
24894.08s: want to be bothered at their
24896.72s: table he'll talk and talk and talk to a
24899.28s: table the entire time they're here about
24901.88s: himself Joe feels that this is his house
24904.12s: and these are his dining guests and they
24905.84s: want to hear all about him which is
24907.48s: nothing worse when you're trying to e
24908.48s: and we're told to give him a minute when
24910.36s: it's our table we're trying to service
24911.60s: them and trying to do what we are our
24913.04s: job and then we get yelled at and
24914.44s: ridiculed in front of them wow he yelled
24917.08s: at me saying when I am with the table we
24919.48s: are in a meeting seriously Rebecca
24921.68s: what's he holding a meeting over what's
24922.88s: he talking about himself himself
24926.00s: himself how' you get through to Joe how'
24928.60s: you get the message across to him we
24931.16s: don't we get told what to
24933.36s: we have meetings all the time but it's
24935.28s: usually him telling us what we've done
24937.96s: wrong to what we should shouldn't do
24941.28s: we've all been ridiculed we've all been
24942.60s: belittled we've all been screamed at and
24944.48s: cussed at and we're doing everything
24945.96s: wrong it it's hard it's hard cuz we want
24948.36s: to see this restaurant succeed but
24950.04s: there's just times when you can't take
24952.64s: it the stress I mean how many of you
24954.68s: thought about quitting at any one
24956.11s: [Music]
24958.32s: time all I ever want to tell Joe is just
24960.60s: to back off not to ridicule every single
24963.20s: thing we're a lot more productive if we
24964.96s: don't have all the extra chaos and stop
24967.12s: blaming us for his inadequacy SC quit
24970.52s: yelling at me Joe doesn't want to take
24972.04s: responsibility tell me always my dad
24974.52s: want to choke Joe out due the way he was
24977.92s: talking it's not
24981.28s: right in order to get through to jail
24983.96s: we've all been screamed at and cussed at
24986.08s: wow Chef Ramsey has asked the staff to
24988.28s: talk about some of the problems at M
24990.00s: Street bastra my dad want to choke Jo
24992.44s: out what doe to the way he was talking
24994.60s: to me and most of them point the finger
24997.16s: at the owner he needs to back off oh my
25001.64s: god well I do have a confession to
25005.56s: make Joe has been
25010.00s: listening I hope that he takes it well I
25013.76s: hope he understands the negativity he's
25016.20s: brought on your shoulders I'll be back
25018.32s: in a second don't move here we go oh
25023.08s: God I'm scared well got to go find a new
25027.68s: job follow
25031.92s: me
25036.68s: guys I was sitting upstairs
25039.72s: listening and I got to
25043.08s: say that what has happened here
25047.72s: ultimately is my responsibility and my
25050.52s: fault I don't think that I'm a bad
25054.20s: person in heart but I'm tough maybe a
25057.04s: little bit too tough for this
25059.60s: business I need to soften
25062.68s: up we got a lot of work a lot of things
25065.64s: need to change and if that means that I
25069.04s: need to change and you need to change
25071.48s: and we all need to change we're going to
25074.36s: do
25076.48s: it Joe immediately went to we need to
25080.32s: change he cannot take respons
25082.12s: responsibility for his own actions this
25084.12s: is not going to work unless you are 100%
25088.40s: behind changing because everything that
25090.44s: this Resturant stands for today is you
25092.32s: yet it's been propped up by your team
25094.80s: are you 100% committed to change I'm
25099.44s: 100% committed to change whatever needs
25103.04s: to be changed to make this restaurant to
25105.68s: find its potential then so am I
25108.96s: okay do I think that he took it all in
25113.24s: no do I think he's going to change no do
25117.52s: I think this is even going to help at
25120.08s: all
25122.48s: no one
25124.36s: second with Joe now seemingly ready to
25127.12s: change Chef Ramsey is ready to
25129.16s: illustrate how Joe's overpriced menu is
25131.88s: alienating the locals in this small
25135.08s: town one of the things I've heard over
25137.12s: and over again is that your place is not
25139.76s: inviting enough for your average local
25142.12s: too pretentious and too expensive it's
25144.00s: way out of their comfort zone if a young
25146.72s: couple want to come in here to eat
25149.08s: they're going to walk out of here
25150.64s: spending minimum $100 that is a lot of
25153.16s: money yeah it is yes a lot of money they
25156.08s: could spend $100 here and put it in that
25158.48s: cash register or they could go to a
25160.64s: local grocery store and get this let's
25163.92s: just have a look
25166.08s: at delicious riy Choice amazing
25170.88s: corn wow now fresh tomatoes yeah and
25174.64s: some salad some cheddar pork chops
25177.48s: potatoes oh some ground I mean that's a
25180.68s: lot of food right that all came to
25185.48s: $89.
25188.80s: 73 oh sorry look bottle of wine as well
25193.92s: that's where I spend my last $11 on just
25196.00s: a little bottle of wine what I'm trying
25198.36s: to say is for $89. 73 they've got
25202.40s: minimum five good evenings in with some
25205.40s: bloody good food that's what you're
25208.00s: going up
25209.28s: against why would you come out it's a
25211.96s: very good question Joe people today want
25215.92s: value and when you pitch that you're the
25218.88s: most expensive restaurant nobody can
25220.80s: touch you you've already shot yourself
25222.80s: in the
25223.72s: foot
25225.28s: agreed we're expensive we're too
25228.20s: expensive Chef's correct it was a a

26706.16s: week but I still have my doubts about

26719.36s: talk and talk and

26984.24s: reality of the heart of the
26987.24s: problem I agree I agree with that
26989.84s: statement that statement I agree with

27062.92s: the problems take a seat I want me to
27064.96s: watch something Chef Ramsey Begins the
27067.24s: day with a plan to show this owner some
27069.60s: of the issues he doesn't even realize he
27071.68s: has tough day yesterday that was a uh a
27075.04s: hard one yeah and I wanted to talk to
27078.48s: you guys without Joe around because I
27081.04s: need to hear the good the bad the ugly
27085.44s: and I'm not talking about skinny the

27105.56s: Joe cuz I've got your
27109.16s: back help
27111.32s: me Amy I think Joe is at fault for the
27116.00s: lack of
27117.84s: business because of the way he berates
27121.20s: the staff in front of the customers uh
27124.40s: it turns people off and turns people
27127.08s: away he needs to control his temper he
27130.44s: was cussing at me right here in front of
27132.04s: the door and then dragged me into the
27133.24s: kitchen and started screaming at me even
27134.56s: louder so I might as well been sitting
27136.76s: right out here and I mean everybody
27138.84s: witnessed it and my table was so
27140.40s: disgusted they just wanted their check
27141.72s: to
27143.28s: leave and they left me a note you know
27146.12s: telling me to keep my chin up and that I
27147.52s: did a great job and everything I was
27148.84s: supposed to do and I had left that note
27151.08s: to Joe and he would tell me don't let
27153.40s: that get to your head when people tell
27154.72s: you you're doing great cuz there's
27156.40s: always mistakes being made it was to the
27158.44s: point where I ended up having to go into
27161.28s: the back because I started crying and I
27163.60s: didn't you know I just didn't want to be
27165.64s: like I don't know I mean and we have Joe
27167.64s: constantly saying well you're doing this
27169.52s: wrong you're doing this wrong we all get
27170.96s: flustered and you
27173.04s: know and
27175.68s: I'm I let it get to me yeah Kaye that's
27179.56s: turn
27180.10s: [Music]
27181.52s: it
27182.28s: is moving forward why does he think his
27184.92s: food is good that's my main thing
27186.96s: because there's stuff that's been
27188.24s: questionable and he's like oh that's
27189.80s: that's okay you know that's okay we can
27191.32s: serve that and I just wanted to say no
27192.92s: we can't serve that but in his mind it's
27195.60s: okay how'd you rate the food out of 10
27198.00s: two of being
27199.96s: generous he loves to hear the praise but
27202.48s: he will certainly go up against anybody
27204.40s: that has anything negative to say the
27206.64s: guy that was sitting there across from
27207.96s: you while you were having lunch he said
27209.16s: he would send back but he doesn't want
27210.52s: to listen to Joe yell at him if they see
27212.64s: Joe's vehicle outside they'll go
27214.68s: somewhere else because they don't want
27216.00s: to be bothered at their
27218.48s: table he'll talk and talk and talk to a
27221.04s: table the entire time they're here about
27223.64s: himself Joe feels that this is his house
27225.92s: and these are his dining guests and they
27227.64s: want to hear all about him which is
27229.20s: nothing worse when you're trying to e
27230.24s: and we're told to give him a minute when
27232.08s: it's our table we're trying to service
27233.36s: them and trying to do it we are our job
27235.16s: and then we get yelled at and ridiculed
27236.96s: in front of them wow he yelled at me
27239.12s: saying when I am with the table we are
27241.36s: in a meeting seriously Rebecca what's he
27243.64s: holding a meeting over what's he talking
27245.12s: about himself himself

27250.36s: you get the message across to him we
27252.92s: don't we get told what to do we we have
27255.36s: meetings all the time but it's usually
27257.48s: him telling us what we've done

27276.44s: thought about quitting at any one
27277.87s: [Music]
27280.08s: time all I ever want to tell Joe is just
27282.36s: to back off not to ridicule every single
27284.96s: thing we're a lot more productive if we
27286.68s: don't have all the extra chaos and stop
27288.88s: blaming us for his inadequacy scw up

27293.52s: take responsibility tell me there's
27295.40s: always my dad want to choke Joe out due
27297.92s: to the way he was talking to back off

27307.88s: wow Chef Ramsey has asked the staff to
27310.04s: talk about some of the problems at M

27322.24s: oh my
27323.40s: god well I do have a confession to
27327.36s: make Joe has been listening
27332.76s: I hope that he takes it well I hope he
27336.20s: understands the negativity he's brought
27338.24s: on your shoulders I'll be back in a
27340.48s: second don't move here we go oh
27344.88s: God I'm scared well got to go find a new
27349.48s: job follow
27353.72s: me
27358.56s: guys I was sitting upstairs
27361.48s: listening and I got to
27364.84s: say that what has happened here
27369.48s: ultimately is my responsibility and my
27372.32s: fault I don't think that I'm a bad
27375.96s: person in hard but I'm tough maybe a
27378.80s: little bit too tough for this
27381.36s: business I need to soften
27384.44s: up we got a lot of work a lot of things
27387.40s: need to change and if that that means
27390.40s: that I need to change and you need to
27392.92s: change and we all need to change we're
27395.84s: going to do
27398.24s: it Joe immediately went to we need to
27402.08s: change he cannot take responsibility for
27404.52s: his own actions this is not going to
27406.44s: work unless you are 100% behind changing
27411.48s: because everything that this restur
27412.72s: stands for today is you yet it's been
27414.52s: propped up by your team are you 100%
27418.32s: committed to change
27420.16s: I'm 100% committed to change whatever
27424.56s: needs to be changed to make this
27426.20s: restaurant to find its potential then so
27429.16s: am I
27430.72s: okay do I think that he took it all in
27435.00s: no do I think he's going to change no do
27439.24s: I think this is even going to help at
27441.84s: all
27444.24s: no one
27446.12s: second with Joe now seemingly ready to
27448.84s: change Chef Ramsey is ready to
27450.92s: illustrate how Joe's overpriced menu is
27453.64s: alienating the locals in this small
27456.76s: town one of the things I've heard over
27458.88s: and over again is that your place is not
27461.52s: inviting enough for your average local
27463.76s: too potential and too expensive it's way
27465.96s: out of their comfort zone if a young
27468.48s: couple want to come in here to eat
27470.80s: they're going to walk out of here
27472.40s: spending minimum $100 that is a lot of
27474.92s: money yeah it is yes a lot of money they
27477.84s: could spend $100 here and put it in that
27480.20s: cash register or they could go to a
27482.40s: local grocery store and get this let's

27529.80s: going up

33027.84s: is the deal first of all I've known
33031.08s: about Rocky being lazy for a really long
33033.28s: time I've called him out on it a
33035.08s: thousand times and you know what I get
33037.20s: this is what you get for how much you
33038.84s: pay me I don't make enough this is you
33041.48s: know that's not entirely accurate well
33043.28s: what it is accurate like he and I go
33045.24s: around once a year about this exact
33047.08s: thing cuz he doesn't make the money that
33048.84s: he wants to make I like him so much in
33051.84s: so many ways and so many things that he
33053.84s: does but he's not held to the same
33055.96s: standard that everybody else is held to
33057.68s: Here by me because what am I going to do
33060.28s: I don't know how to come in here I don't
33061.84s: know how to [ __ ] train anybody else I

33071.04s: some things Rocky is doing good and
33073.16s: every single time I word with you cuz I
33075.84s: I can't [ __ ] sit here and take this
33077.48s: [ __ ] any
33081.68s: longer I am not going to going to listen
33084.40s: to excuses you keep on telling me that
33086.68s: he's good and he's well because he's
33088.92s: been here with me all these four years
33090.60s: and and my feeling is is that he has the
33093.56s: the skills to do it why are you
33096.44s: convinced that he has the skills to do
33098.88s: it because I don't know about that job
33102.52s: and he's been here since day one and he
33104.48s: has led me to believe he led me to
33107.76s: believe he has he has and intuitively
33110.84s: I've known it you allowed him to take
33112.92s: you hostage I have so you deserve what
33115.36s: you get then cuz you're not prepared to
33117.36s: step up no I stepped up I fired him 2
33119.80s: months ago he was gone for a week in the
33122.24s: kitchen they didn't know how to do the
33123.92s: order they just didn't know and then I
33126.16s: brought him back again I feel sorry for
33128.84s: you do you know why you'll being
33131.88s: used step up yeah get a grip yeah cuz
33135.36s: time right now is not your
33137.56s: friend I'm done for tonight
33155.60s: yeah Chef Ramsey thinks he's
33159.28s: unbelievably lazy has got me over a
33163.04s: barrel and the fact that I allow him to
33168.24s: be the kind of Chef that he is here is
33171.36s: unacceptable
33173.40s: well and he's gotten away with it for so
33175.36s: long like how how is he going to change
33177.92s: his behavior after this
33181.35s: [Music]
33191.96s: long after shutting down the restaurant
33195.04s: hello morning ladies let's have a little
33196.92s: see over ahead Chef Ramsey is completely
33199.28s: bewildered he's looking for some
33201.36s: explanation and he begins the day with
33203.88s: Rishi and her staff let's be honest last
33206.36s: night was a
33207.80s: disaster everyone agreed absolutely and
33211.20s: customers were absolutely at their wit's
33213.20s: end I mean there was one table in the
33215.12s: front there that had their dish ref
33216.96s: fired three
33219.00s: times when was the last time that
33220.80s: happened I'd say it happens all the time
33223.28s: yeah yeah honestly can absolutely what
33226.36s: is the response from the chef he usually
33229.44s: takes it really personal and thinks that
33231.56s: they're wrong and the
33233.64s: and the food tastes just fine what does
33235.32s: that tell you it's Rocky he and I
33237.52s: started here at the same time and he was
33239.24s: very passionate in the last 2 years 30%
33242.72s: maybe wow uh last time I worked got 15
33246.76s: orders he goes outside behind the
33248.88s: building 15 orders and your head chef is
33251.48s: outside smoking and I just don't feel
33254.32s: like going outside to get him so I text
33255.96s: him do you think it's right that he
33257.16s: should be outside and you have to text
33258.56s: him to come in oh God no no and we have
33261.84s: to supplement Rockies and
33263.56s: by tipping on average a week we tip him
33265.64s: out 3% of the food the head chef getting
33269.48s: tips he told me that that's what other
33272.08s: people do in other restaurants and
33273.64s: that's fair they put the food out to
33275.48s: give the server the opportunity to earn
33277.80s: the tip so they should deserve that
33279.92s: we've told her though that's not how it
33281.60s: is in the industry no it's not he's made
33284.96s: me feel this way over time that I owe
33287.52s: him why do you owe him because I'm
33290.44s: afraid that I can't make this happen
33293.44s: without him
33296.52s: because so you think because I just I
33298.72s: feel like I don't have the experience to
33300.56s: know what to do if I don't have someone
33302.72s: who so you think he's not replaceable
33304.76s: right so how many people feel that this
33306.64s: restaurant would be better off without
33310.16s: Rocky sorry why' you support Rocky the
33314.92s: way you're doing I'm just scared to take
33317.40s: that chance Rish this is
33319.36s: crazy I know I don't know why I'm like
33321.92s: that I'm not like that in any other
33324.40s: places in my life crazy my
33326.84s: darling you should not be put in this
33329.20s: awful vulnerable situation and be
33331.36s: beholden to a chef that's tearing you
33334.48s: apart Rishi is completely afraid of
33337.00s: change she doesn't like to change her
33339.88s: hair she doesn't like to change her
33342.20s: house she doesn't like to change
33343.60s: anything do you mind if I just talk to
33345.40s: Rishi alone please
33355.39s: [Music]
33357.84s: I'm just scared because
33360.80s: I'm cuz when I when I did this I really
33364.28s: didn't know what I was getting myself
33366.12s: into and then last night when you just
33369.48s: stood up and you told Rocky just stop
33373.32s: begging excuses this is wrong you're
33376.04s: lazy I just have been so scared to do
33379.00s: that I appreciate you honestly I can
33381.44s: really feel especially today that you
33384.60s: care but when I first arrived you were
33386.96s: almost tiptoeing over the issues as
33389.56s: opposed to tackling them head on I
33391.98s: [Music]
33393.60s: know but with Rocky just even if he
33397.28s: steps up right now was to say what's
33399.72s: going to
33401.60s: happen I can't even tell
33404.84s: you but why let the misy go on I don't
33408.16s: want to I'm just so scared
33414.52s: help
33415.52s: me I'm here I'm
33419.00s: here
33420.52s: okay I'm sorry I'm
33423.44s: so come
33427.12s: on I'm here I'm going to get this thing
33431.40s: sorted
33434.60s: okay I was too scared to make that
33437.28s: decision with Rocky and not have
33440.60s: any anyone there that could say okay
33444.04s: well let's do this okay I know I need to
33448.44s: find someone else but I'm just afraid
33451.16s: that there's not going to be somebody
33453.08s: else's that because he has me believing
33455.88s: that like I know I don't pay enough to
33459.48s: have I really listen to me and listen
33462.20s: very
33463.00s: carefully I will do all I
33465.80s: can to find your
33469.68s: Chef thank you
33473.28s: this is your decision your business your
33476.72s: future and your
33478.76s: money you need to take responsibility I
33481.92s: can't do that for you okay I know it has
33485.44s: to be done why would I want to go

33490.60s: business don't worry okay thank you so
33493.96s: much I'll see you shortly I'm getting on
33495.60s: the phone stand strong okay it's the

33512.04s: Rishi now finally understands what is
33514.60s: the main problem of the restaurant oh re
33518.52s: okay
33520.44s: so I'm going to fire Rocky today because
33523.60s: Chef Ramsey's going to help me find
33526.36s: someone became very clear to me that
33529.52s: Rocky's not going to change even if he
33531.28s: says he's going to step up and BL but
33533.04s: he's not going to
33534.84s: change to do it's your business it's

35423.08s: not realing the juice

35436.84s: Chef Ramsey was horrified at the bad
35439.28s: practices sit down please this morning
35442.24s: he has gathered the staff to see if he
35444.32s: can uncover any other major issues with
35447.04s: the restaurant you I came here to help
35449.52s: but my biggest concern right now is
35451.40s: chappy MHM I can't think of a more
35453.60s: dangerous job when you got an owner at
35455.00s: the helm that doesn't care have you ever

36423.36s: you so much good night good
36427.76s: night I've got one word to describe my
36430.60s: time here at chapis and that is
36433.28s: challenging mainly because chaffy LED
36435.28s: his resterant s in so many ways but we
36437.88s: made a major turnaround and he even
36440.40s: agreed to get rid of his ridiculous
36442.08s: chef's hat my only hope now is that he's
36444.44s: got rid of all those bad habits because
36446.36s: if he hasn't this restaurant has no
36450.28s: chance
36454.12s: wow not long after Chef Ramsey left in
36457.64s: spite of positive feedback about the
36459.48s: changes chappie went back to his old
36462.20s: ways you didn't do what I asked you I
36464.44s: should have come behind you and babysat
36465.88s: you you're right the majority of his
36467.72s: original dishes are back black pork chop
36470.08s: black and swordfish on the Fly and so is
36472.36s: the uncertainty of the future of this
36474.52s: Nashville
36480.56s: Restaurant Scottdale Arizona an upscale
36484.28s: Phoenix suburb it's also home to Amy's
36487.20s: Baking Company opened in 2006 by husband
36490.84s: and wife team Sammy and Amy
36493.88s: buzaglo it was at a very early age that
36496.44s: I discovered I had a real true passion
36499.12s: and talent for anything having to do
36501.48s: with the culinary arts just give me the
36503.40s: Persona darling if you can all right all
36505.16s: right so in 2006 Sammy invested over a
36508.08s: million dollars into this restaurant to
36510.04s: make my dream come true can I open y we
36512.56s: are ready come on guys but we're in the
36515.72s: restaurant business it's not all daisies
36518.64s: and ponies and unicorns I don't
36521.12s: understand this whole substitution thing
36523.04s: approximately 2 years ago these
36524.92s: reviewers and these bloggers decided to
36527.56s: make up lies and say that they ate the
36529.04s: food and it was disgusting son of a
36531.28s: [ __ ] and we lost a tremendous amount of
36533.88s: business because of it they're just
36535.76s: [ __ ] haters this really just isn't
36538.48s: good I'll take it there's a lot of
36540.32s: things that are wrong with the food that
36542.08s: she just doesn't realize too garlicky
36544.76s: too buttery too sweet not cooked enough
36547.64s: too overdone that doesn't work for
36550.48s: me if someone has criticism Sammy tells
36553.88s: them you don't know what the food is
36555.40s: supposed to taste like even you don't

38835.92s: to have 65 items on the menu and it's
38838.28s: not normal for the level of animosity

38893.36s: almost 100 Kitchen Nightmares I've met
38895.52s: two owners who I could not help and it
38898.36s: wasn't because I didn't want to it was
38900.48s: because they are incapable of listening
38903.28s: and in a short period of time they
38904.76s: managed to piss off the community and go
38906.92s: through over 100 employees in one year
38910.16s: Sammy and Amy continue to blame everyone
38912.36s: else yet their biggest problem is
38914.60s: themselves and I know whatever changes I
38918.56s: would have made they were never going to
38920.44s: stick to them and that's why I've
38922.52s: decided to do something I've never done
