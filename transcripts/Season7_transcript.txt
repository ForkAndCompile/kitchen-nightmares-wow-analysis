643.28s: your freezer is store B [ __ ] raviolis

990.20s: after the dust cleared Amy and Sammy
992.24s: took to their Facebook and said that it
994.16s: was hacked and that all of the
995.52s: statements that came previously weren't
997.56s: them and it was met with this really
1000.32s: hilarious are you kidding me
1002.52s: collectively from the internet no
1004.12s: clearly you weren't hacked at all I saw
1006.24s: the way that they treated people and
1007.72s: what they said on Facebook is exactly
1009.36s: how they acted in real life there is the
1011.32s: phrase no publicity is bad publicity but
1014.64s: at the same time if you're not careful
1016.60s: the internet can turn you into a sow and
1019.36s: I think that's exactly what happened
1020.79s: [Music]
1022.80s: here the aftermath of the episode
1025.00s: certainly took on a life of its own I
1027.04s: remember when I first walked in to Amy's
1028.76s: Baking Company thinking H why am I here
1031.44s: the dining room is gorgeous the kitchen
1033.32s: is spotless something I'm definitely not
1035.44s: used to on Kitchen Nightmares but when
1037.28s: Amy gave me a tour of her kitchen things
1039.56s: started getting a little strange now
1041.68s: this footage has never been seen before
1043.76s: take a
1045.00s: look so are you the Su Chef yeah yes you
1048.48s: can see I'll take you through our line
1049.96s: do we have any uh male chefs no all
1052.64s: females not only girls why is that
1054.80s: because it's too tiny and my wife she
1057.36s: want only me to be near her she doesn't
1059.60s: want men you know I don't like to bump
1061.24s: in I feel comfortable working with girls
1063.68s: because my kitchen is so tiny we bend
1065.72s: over we bump into each other the mail
1067.44s: chefs their ego is too big and there's
1069.76s: it's too little in my kitchen so they
1071.24s: leave I show them the door and they
1072.88s: don't have my standards they can't clean
1074.68s: like I do there it's like they're doing
1076.16s: me a favor this is how we work I mean
1079.00s: work meticulously because my customers
1081.36s: deserve
1083.20s: it coming up oh God you're crazy wow
1086.52s: some shocking bonus material that has
1088.56s: never been seen until tonight if they
1090.60s: could work like my husband works they
1092.24s: would get their tips he's told them can
1093.72s: you make a CH make a CH and later an
1096.32s: update on what has happened at Amy's
1097.96s: Baking Company since Chef Ramsey walked
1099.96s: out now it's like a tourist site
1102.08s: everybody wants to see if Amy was
1104.48s: actually that crazy plus our revealing
1107.64s: exclusive interview with Sammy and Amy
1109.72s: it's like Disneyland for the
1113.52s: crazies we have three little boys but
1116.24s: they're trapped inside kitty cat's
1117.64s: bodies meow Zeta does it like this and

1145.44s: up with Sammy and Amy but first let me
1148.28s: tell you about some more neverbe seen
1150.68s: footage during my lunch at Amy's Baking
1152.96s: Company I kept telling Sammy what was
1154.56s: wrong with the food but he refused to
1156.68s: tell Amy I remember thinking how strange
1158.76s: was that that he wouldn't relate
1160.20s: anything to his wife but when I came
1162.20s: back for dinner service I learned why
1164.00s: Sammy never shares any negative comments
1166.04s: with Amy because she's completely
1168.72s: incapable of taking
1170.68s: criticism when was the last time you
1172.56s: took criticism from a customer about one
1174.24s: of your dishes um the other day I did I
1178.20s: had it was a Caesar salad the lady
1180.36s: didn't like the Pudo in her Caesar salad
1182.60s: but it's on the menu and if they don't
1184.16s: like it they can have it without it
1186.28s: simple I mean I've taken criticism do
1190.04s: you know what criticism is healthy
1191.76s: unfortunately not enough people told you
1193.44s: the truth oh God you're crazy there you
1195.12s: goal dessert store bought frozen ravioli
1197.92s: yet you still don't get
1199.28s: if I could make everything from scratch
1200.80s: I would and you pull the wall over your
1202.44s: husband's eyes but you can't do it to me
1204.76s: my God you're not even prepared to
1206.04s: listen to anything that's cuz you're not
1207.96s: giving me any constructive criticism
1210.20s: you're just standing talking saying
1212.64s: things that AR even making sense I'm not
1214.28s: in denial about anything I've never had
1216.68s: an issue before because your husband
1218.48s: doesn't tell you no because I know he's
1220.76s: scared to not scared okay no that man
1222.80s: isn't scared of you he's not scared of
1224.24s: anybody my husband if there ever is a
1226.16s: problem immediately he'll bring it back
1228.36s: and let Christine and I know and it's
1230.44s: very rare that it happen today you knew

1278.80s: know where to start Sammy needs to be
1282.00s: removed from this situation a lot of
1285.32s: times I think the customers will
1286.64s: probably not come back because of
1288.12s: something that Sammy may have said to
1289.68s: them like first reaction is just to kind
1292.04s: of yell yes there have been a few
1295.04s: occasional times that he has had an
1297.12s: incident and that I myself have had an

1300.56s: are not perfect but when people come in

1642.32s: Bing company was a complete disaster
1643.84s: from day one I came back on day two with
1646.24s: a plan to turn it around I'm
1648.20s: unfortunately I never got to implement
1649.64s: it because it became clear that it would
1651.80s: be a waste of time I'm sure you're
1653.96s: wondering what's happened to the
1655.12s: restaurant since I left here with an
1657.48s: update is our reporter Anna Garcia
1660.44s: thanks Gordon I'm here in Scottdale
1662.52s: Arizona talking to local people to get
1664.80s: their perspective on everything that's
1666.72s: happened since the show aired everything
1668.64s: from the social media phenomenon to how
1671.44s: it has affected local businesses and I'm
1674.28s: going to try and talk to Amy and Sammy
1676.28s: but first here's an update on how the
1678.36s: restaurant is
1679.76s: doing good luck thank you after Chef
1682.84s: Ramsey left it was just a dramatic mess
1685.76s: no I'm Amy and Sammy thought everyone
1687.76s: was out to get them attitude I've never
1689.76s: seen in my life they fired everyone told
1691.76s: everyone who can do everything on their
1693.08s: own the next day I was called and Amy
1695.72s: and Sammy begged for me to come back so
1698.12s: I did thank you you're welcome Sammy and
1701.04s: Amy saw that I had taken $5 tip from my
1704.44s: customer and had a huge fit over it and
1706.96s: told me that I'm a thief and get out of
1708.68s: his restaurant and I threw the money at
1710.52s: them and I walked out and told them
1711.92s: don't ever talk to me again I'm done
1713.36s: with this place a lot of my friends have
1715.76s: actually gone there just to check it out
1717.96s: because now it's like a tourist site
1719.96s: everybody wants to see if Amy was
1722.48s: actually that crazy we honestly went in
1725.68s: with let's see if the food is really as
1729.04s: people say one of our friends ordered a
1731.00s: drink got it noticed that there was
1732.64s: something floating in the drink it had
1734.60s: three fruit flies in it we called Sammy
1737.32s: over and he got really upset and he said
1739.76s: there are no flies he never even
1742.04s: acknowledged that there was anything
1743.24s: wrong I said to him we didn't bring
1745.48s: flies in our pockets with us and he just
1748.40s: said you have to go you have to go you
1750.52s: have to go we thought they would kind of
1752.52s: wanting to be you know pleasing
1754.20s: everybody and wanting to have the
1755.76s: customers and you know but they were
1758.56s: exactly like we thought they were
1760.00s: they're trying to cash in on their
1761.68s: notoriety if you go to their website
1764.40s: they're selling T-shirts that are
1766.32s: printed with lines from the show it's
1768.80s: not a classy move but becoming a tourist
1771.24s: attraction where they basically make fun
1772.64s: of themselves I think is the only way
1774.44s: for them to survive it's definitely
1776.32s: turned into a spectacle that if you're
1778.12s: in the area you just have to see what
1780.12s: it's all
1783.56s: about she doesn't like to take the
1785.64s: criticize she like to take the
1787.24s: compliments she can't take criticism she
1789.04s: cannot critic have you noticed when she
1791.44s: talks she can't stop because she won't
1793.68s: listen so she'll continue pounding her
1796.44s: own voice rather than actually listen to
1798.56s: criticism but when it's a compliment oh
1800.72s: my God it's amazing my dessert but then
1802.52s: when it's criticism so what I'm asking
1805.12s: why is that ask her that question I have
1808.32s: the same problem for that she cannot
1810.56s: listen criticis but she she's going to
1813.32s: listen to me she's going but she's not
1815.88s: listening just blank there she's not
1818.64s: listening yeah know I know I know I have
1820.72s: a
1821.40s: problem okay can you make a change make
1823.92s: her

1973.72s: tried something new I took all of the
1975.56s: negative things that Gordon Ramsey said
1977.64s: and and I tried to improve on it that's
1979.80s: why I had him come here people come here
1982.08s: to try to set us up because they think
1983.92s: it's funny because they have a hard on
1985.32s: for Gordon Ramsey there was one person
1987.48s: he left on this plate and I have it in
1989.28s: my office and I have the surveillance
1990.84s: camera proof of it he puts a giant
1992.52s: rubber cockroach on the plate and left

1995.96s: thought that that was funny we are
1997.52s: dealing with that daily it's not going
1999.36s: to work here we stood up to Gordon
2001.08s: Ramsey we're going to stand up to the
2002.52s: world cuz we don't go down without a
2004.68s: fight we had to show the world in every
2007.24s: single business business owner out there
2009.16s: that you have to stand up you cannot let
2011.32s: anyone Shake You Down we have a voice he
2014.36s: has a voice and it's up to us to stay
2016.24s: strong and to show our true product and
2019.20s: what we really have to offer here at
2021.32s: Amy's big
2027.16s: company if this business were to be
2029.32s: successful in my opinion you need to
2031.24s: clone me three times clone Sammy three
2034.44s: times clone me three times and I'll be
2036.28s: perfect all the Amy clones are just
2037.80s: start like killing off each other they
2039.96s: just get so sick of each other like one
2041.88s: thing another Amy said like you can't
2044.00s: mix two Amy just doesn't go together in
2047.40s: a moment I'll share with you my final
2049.36s: thoughts on Amy's bacon company but
2051.12s: first let's head back to Scottdale and
2053.08s: our reporter Anna Garcia who's with
2055.20s: Sammy and Amy how was your business
2058.04s: affected by what happened in the episode
2059.80s: we are completely bombarded by the media
2062.84s: by customers by haters by trolls we
2065.40s: become the number one tourist attraction
2066.96s: for for the summer only it's like
2069.24s: Disneyland for the crazies they stand
2070.92s: outside and take pictures just because
2072.32s: they want to see us when they come in
2073.96s: they look at us like they are real and
2075.60s: they almost pass out and then they sit
2077.56s: down and they try our food and they see
2080.00s: who we are as people and they say I
2082.04s: can't believe it it's amazing your
2083.84s: food's incredible how did this ever
2085.48s: happen what's going on here are we being
2087.64s: punked but have you been busy because we
2089.80s: really didn't find anyone who ever said
2091.28s: this place was packed well I'm open for
2093.36s: business right now look how how can I
2095.64s: have any normal business when I have
2097.48s: this all day long what happened with
2099.44s: Facebook with the allegations that you
2100.96s: had been hacked every single post that
2103.44s: was written calling people [ __ ] and
2105.68s: making fun of them for not making money
2107.36s: did not come from us we didn't say those
2109.20s: things now we are because now you have
2111.92s: lit the fire inside of us now when we're
2114.52s: calling people little trolls and telling
2116.68s: them that they have no balls yes that's
2118.32s: us because I think it takes a very
2120.44s: special kind of person it's called a
2121.88s: unic to be able to call someone and
2123.52s: Bully them over the phone or through the
2124.88s: internet when you don't know who they
2126.08s: are nobody make money because there
2127.84s: trolls because Gordon Ramsey told them
2130.52s: I'm stealing tips to the people can we
2132.48s: talk about that can we talk about the
2133.96s: tips I was pretty surprised that the
2136.80s: waitresses didn't keep their tips why
2139.04s: Sammy because I give them hourly very
2141.72s: high I don't give them high between $8
2144.60s: to $14 an hour if it's empty like this
2147.08s: they still go with money if they wait
2148.56s: for the tip they wait like this have you
2150.84s: changed your policy on the tips I CH I
2152.80s: give him tips so is that something good
2154.20s: that came out of the Kitchen Nightmares
2155.56s: is that you now it's not good because
2157.72s: they work with the tip and there is
2159.00s: nobody here then of course they're not
2160.68s: going to make money then their own way
2162.48s: all of this that's happened and you know
2164.84s: have you made any changes to the menu he
2166.72s: can keep his menus his menu he can keep
2168.76s: it for his own what happened to the
2169.96s: ravioli are the ravioli still frozen
2172.32s: still frozen yes still frozen excellent
2175.04s: they excellent Jordon Ramsey also during
2177.12s: the filming I asked him I said would you
2178.80s: let anybody come into your kitchen and
2180.56s: give you the kind of attitude that Katie
2182.16s: gave gave me and not fire them he said
2184.52s: yeah that to me shows me that he's a
2186.32s: pansy if I stand up you got critized for
2189.36s: using that word Amy the reason I said he
2191.28s: was a pansy is because the same reason I
2193.28s: call these yelpers and these people that
2194.72s: hide behind the computer screen the
2196.12s: camel to mafia they are [ __ ] they are
2198.16s: pansies they have no balls because if
2199.76s: they had balls they would come to my
2201.44s: face my husband's face and tell us
2203.08s: exactly all the stuff that the lies the
2204.72s: slanderous stuff that they say online
2206.52s: instead of just hiding behind their
2207.80s: computer screen I have said a lot of
2209.92s: offensive things but when a person is
2212.00s: completely under attack I'm sorry I
2214.24s: would love to be nothing but a lady and
2216.24s: control my language and not have a
2218.24s: severe case of Tourette's Syndrome but
2220.88s: this is what's happened to me because of
2222.80s: the pressure I called that guy a pansy
2224.80s: because he was a pale face pansy ass
2226.80s: Willow that's exactly what I call him
2228.76s: yes I'm going to say things if someone
2230.72s: attacks me I'm not going to stop how
2233.16s: then I will be a pansy and I'm not a
2234.68s: pansy there was a part in the episode
2238.16s: where it showed that Sammy tries to
2240.40s: Shield you from criticism and when
2243.52s: Gordon sent back some food Sammy you
2245.60s: didn't really want to tell Amy not true
2249.04s: because my wife's food is excellent
2251.44s: everybody love my wife's food the reason
2253.88s: that he didn't tell me each plate was
2255.28s: getting sent back is because he knew
2257.68s: that it Gordon Ramsey was full of [ __ ]
2259.64s: Sammy tells everything to me as I tell
2262.12s: everything to Sammy we share we don't
2263.96s: keep secrets from each other he protects
2265.84s: me I protect him people love us because
2268.36s: we stand together and we are united yes
2270.72s: he and I will fight to the death for
2272.56s: each other no doubt you come and you try
2274.32s: to attack us I'm going to be like a
2275.72s: fierce lion I'm going to attack anybody
2277.88s: that's coming to try to hurt my husband
2279.52s: or my business it has affected your
2281.16s: business are you seeing the customers
2283.04s: come back something different different
2285.40s: people you know different people they
2286.92s: they come they they are very happy
2288.44s: surprised surprised what Gordon Ramsey
2290.80s: say I have enough money to keep my
2293.20s: business as long till the stupid people
2295.72s: become smart and then they come again to
2297.84s: us and they will we are not the ones
2299.96s: Gordon R represent us we are not at all
2303.00s: we are not a villain or gangster or what
2306.20s: I am reformed and I I I give up the long
2308.36s: but you did say you did say you did say
2310.72s: to I'm A Gangster I you say it again I

2315.56s: am the one who can go on top of him he
2317.08s: cannot go on top of me I can promise you
2319.04s: not him and not all his people I can

2342.84s: us if you do come and attack us we will
2344.36s: scream at you and we will throw you out

2348.20s: being said about us we sit and we laugh
2350.12s: our butts off about it because it's
2351.52s: hysterical do you have a message for
2353.24s: Gordon Ramsey Mr Ramsay for all the

2357.44s: to really put the truth and really give
2358.96s: us a chance really give us a chance easy

3564.56s: right on every damn thing he

3688.92s: anymore I'm coming out for a
3692.68s: minute I don't know you know what I
3695.20s: realized that it was like this for many
3697.48s: many years and I've been nagging and
3699.68s: screaming and carrying
3701.72s: on this place either changes or lock the
3705.08s: [ __ ] doors oh I I'm done if you don't
3707.60s: change and do what he says you'll never

3711.20s: give to fly and you know what's what
3713.68s: happens to everything I own you be here
3716.24s: by
3716.92s: yourself everybody calm down yeah yeah

3722.60s: need to change now I know what I'm doing
3725.60s: Joshua and poet do not understand about
3728.88s: running this place I got more experience
3732.08s: that they both of them put
3734.52s: together
3736.92s: so there you have it
3747.04s: after seeing how stubborn Pete was about
3749.04s: his food the pizza is not good I'm still
3752.56s: going to disagree with you and is
3754.20s: claimed that he has the best pizza in
3755.92s: the city Chef Ramsey knew he had to do
3758.56s: something to finally get through to him
3760.48s: we're going to be tasting three
3762.04s: Margarita pizzas so he headed downtown
3764.44s: it was kind of a little mushy too much
3766.08s: cheese to do a little organized research
3768.60s: thank you guys I appreciate
3771.44s: it now armed with the findings from The
3774.04s: Taste testy good
3776.76s: Chef Ramsey returns to pant Leon's to
3779.32s: confront Pete with the
3781.64s: results one thing that is very clear I
3784.80s: think Pete you have overestimated how
3788.32s: good your pizza
3789.68s: is I don't think you've ever compared it
3793.00s: to what's happening in Denver right now
3795.12s: so after my disappointing lunch
3798.16s: yesterday I did a little research in
3802.44s: Denver how about all of you stand up and
3804.56s: come and stand over here please
3806.52s: yeah and here it comes Pete it's now
3810.36s: time to really find out how good your
3813.20s: pizzas are three pizzas in front of me a
3815.80s: b c a is from one of the best
3818.32s: restaurants in town B is your pizza and
3822.00s: C is a store-bought local frozen pizza
3826.00s: time to put your pizza to the test
3828.20s: that's right your pizza is B which was
3830.32s: your favorite I like the a I'd say a I
3832.64s: like the a because it was thin and your
3834.88s: least favorite B
3837.60s: why B soggy on the crust way too much
3839.80s: cheese it overwhelmed everything else
3841.32s: felt my heart stop it was too much too
3843.24s: much on the crust the crust was soggy it
3846.24s: was just not very
3849.12s: good okay Pete here's results in
3851.64s: nutshell 75% of our taste testers
3854.64s: preferred pizz Ray from the top local
3856.44s: Italian restaurant in second place with
3858.68s: 15% of the votes was a store bought
3860.92s: frozen pizza and in third and last
3863.72s: position was yours with 10% only of the
3867.04s: votes yours was the least favorite
3869.72s: you're actually beaten by a store-bought
3871.92s: [ __ ] frozen pizza get the
3876.52s: message wow yeah

4940.28s: much in the past 30
4942.24s: years my wife and I are in dead to the

10740.92s: failure of the restaurant Evelyn thank
10743.64s: you so much for coming to meet me
10744.72s: appreciate it how are you Chef Ramsey
10746.56s: decides to get some clarity from their
10748.20s: daughter Evelyn who works part-time at
10750.56s: Cala wow I mean first of all we think
10753.40s: how peaceful and tranquil this setting
10756.08s: is is the opposite end the Spectrum for
10758.72s: what I've just left have you witnessed
10760.60s: that recently you
10761.92s: kidding I'm the referee I'm the one
10764.28s: that's like all right everyone in their
10765.80s: Corner calm down yeah how long has it
10768.72s: been like this for too long you can have
10771.96s: multiple owners in a business but if
10773.68s: there isn't one voice you're not going
10775.36s: to get anywhere no you're right
10777.32s: absolutely right when my dad sees you
10779.12s: and you say what are you doing you're
10780.20s: not supposed to do it that way at the
10781.68s: end of the day what's someone to think
10784.36s: so you do your own thing yeah have you
10787.40s: seen your father change over the years I
10790.56s: have I think the pressure has gotten to
10792.92s: the both of them the only problem is he
10795.24s: tends to be the first one to check out
10797.52s: just go yeah you can say that yet but
10801.24s: you know they're both not perfect and
10802.72s: definitely my my mom's made some
10804.88s: mistakes as well
10807.08s: ready she doesn't like to maybe appease
10811.04s: a customer who's obset and my dad she
10814.36s: doesn't trust him maybe it's it's easier
10818.64s: to point a finger than to look in the
10820.52s: mirror this is the most sensible
10822.48s: conversation I've had since I've been in
10826.04s: Queens how close are they to divorcing
10829.44s: you know they've been so close as of
10832.32s: recent it's you know I can't do it
10834.44s: anymore but I do believe it's a lot it
10838.56s: it takes a toll on on me because no one
10840.84s: wants to see their family that way
10842.20s: especially their parents but then
10849.76s: you know I don't want them to work 15
10851.84s: hours a day 7 days a week for crying out
10854.60s: loud you deserve more out of life and

10859.24s: much I wish I had an easy fix I wish I
10862.64s: could fix it for them
10864.56s: but and they just need they need
10867.08s: somebody to bring them back to life they

15163.84s: I did not once say anything if I've said
15165.96s: anything is that the people that are
15167.68s: around her are incompetent and she has a
15170.40s: right to be pissed off that's what I've
15172.32s: said I've never said anything about her

15198.72s: either I know what I said and I never
15200.56s: said nothing I and I know what the
15202.04s: customers have said to me I don't I I I
15204.08s: can't deal with what people are telling
15205.52s: you I'm telling you what I know all the
15208.48s: stuff that's wrong in this place I could

15213.24s: to be helpful I'm trying to help you out
15215.20s: I'm trying to put you in a place where
15216.72s: all of us can make a little bit more
15218.12s: money and if somebody took that as me
15219.92s: being rude to Julie hey man that's just
15223.16s: way it is you
15224.60s: crazy you want to know what the problem
15226.84s: is around here it's it's it's blar it's
15229.56s: got stars all around it Julie there
15233.36s: seems to be an air of discomfort with
15235.60s: you around the customers and the staff
15237.88s: why are you so agitated I have to be in
15240.04s: the back and helping the staff and it's
15243.72s: too stressful trying to do both I just
15245.64s: think you should focus more on managing
15247.32s: I mean you have a hard
15248.88s: time focusing on what you need to yeah
15251.48s: you're too scattered y
15254.20s: yeah you need more Oran no no but I
15255.64s: think what you haven't done is you
15257.08s: haven't prioritized the list of
15258.44s: importance in terms of what you need to
15259.76s: accomplish right because you seem far
15261.72s: too agitated and way too on edge I agree
15264.96s: but some of the blame is my staff the
15267.04s: whole staff no the major issues in the
15269.88s: restaurant or Trevor Trevor is creating
15273.36s: a lot of stress in the restaurant
15274.84s: because he has a bad attitude he doesn't
15277.28s: want to work he wants to stand behind
15278.92s: that line and only cook his food I
15281.48s: cannot schedule him in the day or he
15283.64s: just won't show up okay he just doesn't
15285.76s: show up how long's this been going on
15287.56s: for it's gotten really bad in the last
15290.56s: six 8 months really bad so he's checked
15293.24s: out yes he's absolutely taking advantage
15295.92s: of me because my hands are tied because
15297.60s: I don't have anybody else in the
15298.64s: restaurant and the days that he doesn't
15300.28s: appear what are the excuses he doesn't
15302.68s: have an excuse he just doesn't show
15305.00s: up uh Trevor your side what's going on
15308.16s: have you given up I had those days yes M
15312.12s: some days are better than others not
15314.04s: only are you in way over your head but
15315.68s: you're you're at your depth yes sure one
15318.12s: mistake happens and you get angry with
15320.24s: everybody how long have you felt so
15322.28s: angry behind that line it's grown and
15324.88s: built over this past year why did you
15326.68s: come in with that
15327.76s: attitude I was in over my head at the
15330.92s: time I was in my own personal
15334.24s: problems and it brought it into the
15336.56s: restaurant
15337.76s: mhm and this is part of the problem when
15340.64s: Trevor gets angry and has one of his
15343.08s: fits it happens in the restaurant while
15345.08s: we're full Andy calls me quite a bit and
15347.92s: says Trevor's refusing to cook he's out
15350.08s: back smoking there's tickets on the line
15351.56s: you need to come to the restaurant
15353.00s: because he's acting like an ass and
15355.00s: saying I won't cook and none of this has
15356.88s: brought to my attention at the time how
15358.44s: am I supposed to fix something if it's
15360.00s: because we're scared of you Trevor I'm
15362.40s: scared of you rise when you went for
15365.52s: Janelle personally why does the job take
15368.32s: you that far in the unknown that you get

15629.12s: would have yeah I didn't
15632.92s: know I'm embarrassed I can't believe any
15636.16s: of this went on but I think having
15638.72s: Trevor being so young and inexperienced
15641.20s: on my line and me expecting him to know
15644.12s: how to move this restaurant forward it
15645.84s: was a big mistake I'm very nervous to go
15648.40s: forward I don't know what's going to
15651.16s: happen from now I just don't
15660.48s: know after learning that Maja maja's
15663.08s: head chef Trevor has been abusing drugs
15666.00s: Julie has decided to let him go now Chef
15669.00s: Ramsey wants to make sure that Julie is
15671.12s: committed to making big changes to
15673.08s: putting her restaurant on a path to
15675.16s: success the atmosphere in here is
15677.80s: Dreadful everybody is at such a high
15680.76s: stress level okay but with regards to
15683.68s: Trevor I didn't know I I I understand I
15686.36s: have a lot of experience with addict and
15688.36s: he is in a bad place right now he's not
15690.40s: fit to be a head cook or a senior cook
15692.48s: or a personal
15694.12s: responsibility I I knew that I needed to
15696.56s: let Trevor go I knew that he was the
15698.52s: cancer in the restaurant that was
15699.76s: causing a lot of bad attitude okay I
15701.72s: respect your decision
15703.84s: but I would seriously like you to
15706.12s: consider down the road if he gets his
15707.76s: act together just keeping that door open
15710.64s: I will he needs to step up and get clean
15712.92s: okay I understand but here's the thing I
15716.88s: need to know now that you deep down
15719.52s: inside are seriously committed to change

15724.28s: absolutely 100% she us to have a better
15726.72s: Vision because you're so fragmented I
15728.84s: agree and you're not focusing on

15732.20s: business I'm too spread out you weren't

15737.56s: food
15739.24s: no we've got to change the food the food
15741.92s: has got to be changed good it's [ __ ]
15744.72s: what other things did you think about
15747.28s: that you want to change I need to quit
15750.52s: waiting tables and I need to have better
15752.28s: communication with my staff that's a
15754.08s: huge commitment it is that's what you
15755.68s: just said just said I can do this it's
15758.16s: true it's true I agree I need to take
15761.16s: care of this we've got a to fill in the
15763.12s: kitchen yes we do and I'm terrified and
15766.84s: this place needs a chef that can help
15769.00s: run this business from the engine room
15770.72s: and to get the business afloat and up
15772.44s: and running and making more money no I
15774.36s: yeah I I agree absolutely agree with you
15777.20s: I'm going to make some calls and I got
15779.12s: to get help okay I appreciate it thank
15783.36s: you it's time to make some serious
15785.72s: changes in this restaurant I know I've
15787.52s: been part of the problem but I'm ready
15789.60s: to go forward and make this restaurant
15791.72s: successful
15793.56s: now that Julie understands the necessity
15795.68s: of dramatic changes to the restaurant
15797.72s: Chef Ramsey wants to show Julie the
15799.68s: impact and importance of fresh
15801.92s: ingredients I'm going to cook you're
15803.36s: going to watch okay so two dishes we're
15805.20s: going to make a simple lasagna and a
15807.04s: simple roast Salon have you ever
15808.84s: functioned this restaurant without
15810.28s: microwaves no wow and how many
15812.92s: restaurants do you think functions more
15814.80s: with their microwaves than they do with
15815.92s: their Ovens that I don't know no not
15818.00s: many at all that's all changing as well
15820.08s: okay I can't wait for Chef Ramy to show
15822.04s: me how a real true kitchen is supposed
15824.32s: to be run he's going to teach me how to
15826.12s: cook because we're doing it all wrong so
15828.32s: the exciting thing about laso is in the
15829.84s: layers tomato meat sauce mozzarella
15832.40s: pasta how difficult was that looks
15833.96s: pretty easy 5 minutes pretty easy okay
15836.44s: what do you dislike about being in the
15837.92s: kitchen the most the stress of being
15839.68s: behind the light when you've got a great
15841.28s: prep and you've got yourself organized
15842.92s: it becomes the most pleasurable and the
15844.48s: most distressful thing you can ever do
15846.44s: with salt little pepper now into the
15848.56s: microwave for 4 minutes [ __ ] off are you
15850.68s: serious you're good at taking orders but
15852.76s: you've got a brain use it okay open up
15855.24s: the fridge and take that out please what
15856.84s: is that salmon yeah what do you mean
15859.04s: salmon fresh salmon how do you know it's
15860.84s: fresh because I can tell by the look of
15862.60s: it it's got that dark pink color right
15865.20s: how' you cook salmon they cook it on the
15867.52s: flat top now cooking salmon this way is
15869.88s: a lot easier than it is on that solid
15871.84s: top once you've got a good color in
15873.48s: Salmon turn it over
15875.40s: once that was so much better the
15878.48s: practice you were doing beforehand was
15880.04s: so much more difficult you can do all
15881.68s: these beautiful dishes is so easy in a
15883.32s: short amount of time and make them fresh
15885.00s: we are done with microwaves we are done
15886.92s: with frozen food I am buying everything
15889.24s: fresh this is just a small sample of how
15892.44s: exciting your Italian Fair could be and
15895.16s: when you're the only restaurant within a
15896.48s: 15 to 20 M radius serving food like this
15899.04s: trust me this should be a queue up
15900.56s: outside the door and we are relaunching
15903.76s: this restaurant tomorrow and we all have
15905.84s: to work as hard as we've ever had to

16579.92s: her or this place won't
16582.08s: survive Julie
16584.44s: yes that's the transition understanding
16587.04s: the ways experienc that with this food
16589.64s: so you need to understand just the pace
16591.00s: slows down a bit okay remember we're a
16593.12s: different restaurant than we were at the
16595.04s: beginning of the week I'll be very
16596.44s: careful I absolutely got the point I
16598.64s: have to remember this isn't a fast food
16600.28s: restaurant anymore we are are cooking
16602.04s: everything fresh to order and it takes
16604.04s: time to get there it's different service

16922.04s: business is great it's going to be a
16923.64s: wonderful year I know it
16926.40s: [Music]
16933.16s: Redondo Beach California just blocks
16935.96s: from the ocean is Zena Flaming Grill
16938.92s: open in 2009 by the ants and niece team
16942.24s: Fay and
16943.44s: Brenda for table I'm Egyptian I came to
16947.16s: United State at 18 my first experience
16950.92s: was a caring truck for 16 years and it
16954.32s: was really successful but I always
16956.56s: wanted to buy my own restaurant it was
16959.28s: always my dream to have my own business
16961.44s: and when the door opened about opening a
16963.72s: restaurant with Fay I decided to give
16966.44s: her a call since she had kitchen
16968.40s: experience and I had management
16970.92s: experience when I puted meat somewhere
16973.88s: in the grill do not move it I just
16976.36s: checked them it's done the reason why
16978.72s: this place is going downhill is because
16980.44s: of the drama between F and Brendon
16982.36s: actually all this was on this side these
16984.00s: were on this side they're not families
16986.44s: don't want to come here because why
16987.92s: would you want to come to a restaurant
16989.48s: with arguing and stress it's
16991.64s: embarrassing oh my
16993.56s: God f is definitely the scary boss here
16996.32s: she's the one who pushes people screams
16999.40s: at people you guys need to take the meat
17001.76s: when the order comes out she'll tell the
17004.56s: staff shut up be quiet get out of the
17006.72s: kitchen then move move from here stop
17009.60s: arguing with me I don't want to hear it
17011.72s: zip it move move don't worry about that
17014.92s: right now do not move the tickets F
17017.08s: needs help but she doesn't want to
17019.32s: accept it from anybody I no what I'm
17021.88s: talking about you guys fate doesn't
17024.24s: trust me to run this place the Salah
17026.40s: does not think anything you see me
17027.40s: standing here doing nothing she sees me
17029.20s: as her niece and not her partner it's a
17031.32s: complete joke I'm obviously doing stuff
17034.36s: binda doesn't seem to care anymore go

17045.08s: binda right now is Brenda's just
17047.92s: laziness I want you to be stronger
17050.32s: person but that's your personality it's
17052.60s: not that I'm not just because I'm not

17071.48s: put a strain on my entire family I
17073.80s: really have to go I'm I'm done nobody
17077.76s: understands how much stress I'm under
17079.72s: I've borrowed from my parents a little
17081.84s: over 60 Grand if the restaurant fails I
17084.28s: feel like I would have failed my family
17086.60s: but you know what we really need help if
17088.48s: I don't smile I going to explode I going
17090.56s: to cry the restaurant is my
17093.08s: life but it became a
17095.64s: burden it seems like it's slipping

17119.48s: arriving at the restaurant how are you
17121.36s: Brenda right yes he realizes that this
17123.64s: is a perfect opportunity to get both

17139.16s: before I went inside the restaurant yes
17141.32s: I want to tell you some issues that I
17143.60s: have with my business partner my niece
17146.08s: Brenda tell me about the restaurant how
17148.04s: did it start say had this idea and saw a
17150.80s: location that she really liked and
17152.72s: approached my mom and she said that I
17154.92s: would possibly be interested it kind of
17156.88s: just took off from there you know and it
17158.52s: seemed like it was the right thing to do
17160.96s: and are you 50/50 yes we're 50/50
17163.68s: Partners right so explain the roles of
17166.28s: the restaurant I shop I cook I clean

17175.96s: hell does Brenda
17177.56s: do
17180.12s: um basically there's different days
17182.72s: where I am serving and there's days
17184.80s: where I'm on the line with Fay and it
17187.84s: can get a little overbearing back there
17189.88s: cuz Fai she's definitely a control freak
17193.04s: she doesn't have confidence in me
17194.60s: stepping into the kitchen and being able
17196.48s: to help her out and she was just like no
17198.48s: you're not doing it right and I
17200.20s: sometimes feel like I'm an employee not
17201.96s: an eagal I have to prepare everything
17205.76s: for Wednesday when I take off every
17208.48s: literally every why can't Brenda prep
17210.36s: for her one day running that business
17212.56s: independently um she doesn't know she
17215.92s: stayed out with friends and she's very
17217.96s: tired the kids that tell me when I'm not
17220.16s: there we sit in the computer watch TV or
17224.60s: watch how does the business run on those
17226.96s: nights when your Auntie's not there very
17228.80s: smoothly customers are happy with the

17549.08s: food so this is our combination

17555.28s: on there we usually drizzle the top of
17557.12s: our appetizers with olive oil or flood

17563.60s: say could I have a teaspoon please D of
17565.56s: course thank you wow you drizzle

17632.44s: liquid is that normally that runny that
17634.16s: the humus I've been told it depends on
17635.52s: the Ganzo Beans really we're going to
17637.12s: start blaming a [ __ ] Bean for the
17638.48s: hummus there's times where the hummus
17640.24s: will be extremely thin and there's times
17641.72s: where the hummus will be overly thick
17643.72s: yeah it's not the Bean's fault it's the
17645.48s: chef's I feel like I'm always
17647.24s: apologizing for the food now don't I'm
17649.56s: done with that okay but I'm not a chef
17652.32s: it's out of my control who put the oil
17654.92s: on top of the appetizer I didn't do the
17657.04s: appetizer I did it he said it's a lot of
17659.92s: oil it's tradition to put a good amount
17662.60s: of oil on hummus so for Chef Ramsey not
17665.24s: to like it as a shocker to meet I should
17667.52s: have made it for
17673.92s: him it's a disgusting busing station it

18001.72s: looks um medium well well done it's
18004.00s: drier than Mark's
18005.56s: personality and the cofa sadly is
18008.24s: overcooked and dry that's dry than the
18010.36s: Sands around in the pyramids of Egypt is
18012.56s: Dreadful and the chicken is bland is the
18014.96s: chicken fresh or is that Frozen the

18021.00s: mixture of F and bread I'm pretty I
18022.48s: think they um tag teamed on on the
18024.84s: dishes new tag team you'd expected to be
18027.08s: twice as good but this one's twice as
18028.92s: bad uh Dy I'm done wow that
18032.60s: disappointing thank you

18041.04s: disappointment there's not been one
18042.96s: thing that he said he liked not even one
18045.20s: I them have let's uh let's come over
18049.04s: please wow I don't know where to start
18051.08s: ready um f Brenda I'm so
18055.56s: disappointed the atmosphere's flat the
18058.60s: deco's drab and I'm sat on the corner of
18061.92s: a ridiculous cushion opposite a large
18065.72s: container of dirty sheds they've never
18068.20s: done that before that's what's BZ that
18070.20s: me today um excuse me um we do that
18073.12s: every week I believe you and Vanessa use
18075.48s: buckets don't you but don't put the
18077.24s: buckets in the floor well it doesn't
18078.84s: matter if it's on the floor I don't
18079.88s: think that's the issue I think the fact
18081.00s: that the buckets in view of the
18082.16s: customers they walk inside the kitchen
18084.00s: with them but we have been told to use a
18086.88s: bucket I always asked you guys to use a
18089.40s: bucket so stuff doesn't spill all over
18091.20s: the place but we've never said to put it
18095.32s: on the floor yeah you use a table or the
18097.96s: one of the chairs and you take them back
18099.40s: inside when they're almost WR but
18101.28s: they're still in front of the customers
18102.48s: if we leave them on the chair put them
18103.96s: in the floor I'm a little confused do we
18105.84s: leave them on the floor never yes wow
18109.56s: but settle that aside I've just had a
18111.92s: bad experience and I felt the food was
18115.16s: below standard the homus was running
18117.68s: very liquidy why so much oil on there I
18120.20s: have Arabic customers that like loads of
18123.00s: olive oil when customers want more oil
18125.64s: don't assume that every wants more oil I
18127.84s: don't even think it was olive oil what
18129.24s: was that oil olive oil it was olive oil
18131.68s: wow that must be cheap um what's
18135.32s: funny um our product is not cheap your
18138.00s: product's not cheap okay so what's so
18140.40s: funny well you said it was cheap uh it
18142.84s: tasted cheap it's not expensive but it's
18144.92s: not cheap I'm not going to argue with
18146.28s: you but you sit there on your ass
18147.80s: laughing your head off thinking it's
18149.04s: funny I'm not going to get upset because
18150.76s: of what you say no I'm just going to
18152.56s: smile about it it's it's your opinion
18154.40s: how old are you 26 sir I'd expect that
18156.48s: if you're 16 cuz right now Mark is very
18159.32s: far from
18160.40s: funny can I continue about my lunch for
18163.40s: me a cofa when you bite into it it just
18165.88s: bursts with flavor this thing was dry
18168.28s: beyond belief but this is number one
18170.48s: seller this is what my customer eats
18172.56s: every time they walk in but F chicken
18174.68s: was dry and the beef was dry is that
18177.60s: protein Frozen We Buy it fresh I buy it
18180.08s: fresh we Marin bu fresh so there's a
18182.52s: system prep freeze and cook I don't know
18186.44s: why you think customers would leave
18188.64s: their homes to come and eat frozen food
18191.08s: I don't have a walk-in freezer and I
18192.80s: don't have a walk-in cooler okay so my
18195.60s: option is to freeze it then cook it how
18198.20s: long have you been functioning like this
18199.96s: 18 months two years no it's been like
18202.68s: this since day

20642.40s: little insight to how it went I thought
20644.84s: the heat was on for quite a few minutes
20647.44s: just because we got slammed with orders
20649.16s: but with the communication with me and
20650.84s: Mark uh tag teaming on the grill and
20653.64s: just communicating across the board one
20655.36s: or two uh plates come back but when we
20657.48s: put it back out not one complaint I have
20660.16s: a confession to make Fay did not go home
20664.32s: she was with you because she was sat
20666.64s: behind the restaurant in the car park
20669.00s: watching everything you did listening to
20671.80s: everything you said on a monitor and I
20674.52s: think she has something she'd like to
20676.76s: say you all I'm really proud of you all
20680.16s: there is a few mistakes that we can work
20682.44s: on and what did you think of Brenda's
20684.12s: performance amazing you're amazing and I
20687.00s: feel like I don't tell you enough it's
20689.08s: an eye opener for me what I saw today to
20691.96s: see how hard you work and I commend you
20694.04s: for taking a charge and I did this
20696.00s: little exercise for fatal watch to
20698.32s: understand how good you are and let me
20700.28s: tell you something you clearly passed
20702.56s: the test you did I was proud of you all
20707.00s: we do have to improve the food right
20708.56s: granted yes but for me the relationship
20710.64s: was far more important than the food
20711.80s: first today is a new beginning okay give
20714.72s: me 15 minutes and I'd like to get into
20716.92s: the kitchen and start cooking something

20739.92s: bothering us I know now we have to work
20742.80s: as a team and I hope that we could move

20748.84s: perfect we need to act like a team and
20750.80s: we need to strive as a team and I
20753.36s: realize it's about time to treat Brenda

20761.08s: fix a lot of things we definitely proved

21550.32s: them they had no Direction but
21552.40s: unbelievably tonight brender and Fay
21554.48s: were working side by side in their

21581.28s: you to flip the chicken because this is
21582.84s: the hottest but it's burning that's why

24341.16s: kind of background do you have I don't
24343.00s: have experience of owning my own
24345.40s: restaurant neither did my son but we all
24348.24s: have the passion for food and since
24350.60s: Franco went to school and he wanted to
24352.68s: become a chef you know this was our
24354.48s: dream so he has restant
24356.88s: experience uh well when he finished
24358.92s: school he did an internship in Manhattan
24361.84s: and then after that we just jumped in
24363.48s: here so I won't say I say he had
24366.96s: internship to ownership yes no come on
24369.76s: so we yes what about the big bit in
24371.44s: between the things called experience
24373.60s: didn't have any but you had a vision we
24375.76s: had a vision wow followed it so how's
24378.12s: the food I think it's more authentic
24380.28s: than than other places around here we
24382.92s: make everything fresh we don't use
24384.36s: anything Frozen that's quite know we
24386.68s: only have one freezer and this is the
24388.28s: way I want it to be I want to bring out
24390.64s: fresh Italian food but why wouldn't e
24392.52s: embrace that why wouldn't they support
24393.88s: you I don't know I think they're used to
24395.08s: one thing and like if they're used to
24396.36s: frozen food and you give them fresh
24398.72s: authentic they will not appreciate it so
24400.60s: you're saying that'd be more upset with
24402.48s: fresh as opposed to Frozen yeah the food
24405.12s: is not the problem here it's probably

24707.12s: exaggerating but it's like
24709.64s: Overcoat disgusting but the flavor is
24712.00s: not bad oh I disagree you disagree with
24714.92s: the flavor the sauce is Bland there's no
24716.68s: salt in the sauce and there's too much
24717.92s: garlic but for me the fundamentals when
24720.12s: you come to an Italian restaurant is the
24721.92s: pasta the past is overcooked that's the
24723.48s: embarrassing part anyway can you get the
24725.28s: chef to taste there okay excellent thank
24728.20s: you
24729.76s: wow face the pasta he said it's drowned
24732.92s: in sauce that it doesn't have any flavor

24741.00s: deal 8 out of
24743.44s: 10 trust me right now he's not even 8

24749.96s: hope good luck
24754.68s: wow uh are we
24756.68s: sure that's
24758.96s: it when I think of Italian cuisine is
24761.36s: done with exciting generous amount of
24763.76s: muscles in a bowl but that has to be the
24765.52s: tightest portion of muscles I've ever
24767.28s: seen in my entire life is that what
24769.08s: customers get this is what customers get
24771.28s: Chef how much is that not really sure

24870.52s: kicking the balls for me the must
24872.56s: actually Frozen why are you serving
24874.56s: frozen
24875.88s: muscles no I I need to know because you
24878.44s: told me fresh I'm only going on what you
24879.96s: told me we don't sell enough muscles for
24882.80s: me to have them fresh every week so then
24885.00s: what's the most important thing to do

24915.76s: did tell take them off the menu why is
24918.12s: it still

24923.08s: constant circle of miscommunication who
24924.96s: wants it off who wants it on and it
24926.44s: still stays on by the end of the
24928.56s: week I don't know what it is thinking
24931.00s: that you can just bu bu a restaurant
