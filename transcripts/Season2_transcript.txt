0.00s: last year Gordon attempted to turn
2.46s: around restaurants all across America in
5.28s: a moment you'll hear how some of them
7.02s: are doing today but first a look back at
10.14s: what Finn McCool's was like when Gordon
12.36s: arrived a year ago Finn McCool's is a
15.54s: family-run restaurant set in the heart
17.34s: of New York's exclusive Beach Resort The
19.80s: Hamptons it didn't take long for Gordon
22.50s: to see this Irish Pub had lost its way
24.72s: oh
26.64s: it's a grin buddy the Patriarchs
28.98s: struggled to keep his business together
30.54s: we're in trouble right now and his sons
32.64s: were ready to tear each other apart you
35.16s: don't listen to anything I want to say
36.30s: you almost want to tell him to shut up
37.82s: while Jason tended the bar Brian the
41.52s: chef was drunk with power in the kitchen
43.62s: enough get out of here Melissa Jason's
47.16s: wife was caught in the middle Brian
48.96s: Jason butt heads a lot my problems are
51.54s: more my brother get out of here I would
54.30s: definitely not recommend working with
55.38s: family hello as soon as Gordon stepped
58.26s: foot into Finn McCool's it was clear
60.36s: this family was in major trouble so
63.06s: what's the problem
70.64s: the Family Feud was taking a toll on
73.56s: buddy and his business they just don't
75.90s: have any money
77.04s: but he is in debt somewhere in the
78.78s: hundreds of thousands
80.40s: a retired cop he poured his life savings
83.34s: into Finn McCool's and watched it go
85.62s: right down the drain if there was no
88.20s: significant Improvement how long could
89.64s: you afford to stay open for we're in
91.32s: trouble right now you know we're
92.82s: probably I would say five thousand
94.62s: dollars a week under what we need to
96.00s: survive so 20 grand a month I haven't
98.28s: taken a check yet and you can't cash
99.84s: them no we need this for our families
103.50s: when we're in every night going to bed I
106.32s: should be able to pay this mortgage
108.18s: can't describe to you how stressful that
110.40s: is
111.62s: the debt and family fighting were
114.30s: dragging Finn McCool's down and the food
116.64s: unfortunately only made matters worse
118.92s: here you are spring rolls with Coleman's
121.56s: mustard well
124.92s: are they popular on the menu
127.20s: um people really like them
129.96s: no doubt half the Customs are drunk
133.74s: the one dish an Irish Pub should be
136.08s: known for is shepherd's pie sent Gordon
138.54s: over the edge it's just a big bowl of
140.76s: Grease
141.13s: [Music]
145.76s: that's disgusting
148.64s: second door on the left oh no
152.40s: [Music]
155.76s: oh my God
159.20s: having barely recovered from the
161.52s: shepherd's pie Gordon decided it was
163.80s: time Chef Brian heard the painful truth
166.02s: when a chef can't make a [ __ ]
167.88s: shepherd's pie it worries me was that
170.46s: you at your best whatever he has to tell
172.74s: me I don't really care
173.86s: [Music]
178.64s: to observe the staff of Finn McCool's in
181.56s: action Gordon invited the local fire
183.54s: department
184.82s: but the Brigade was less than impressed
187.68s: is there something wrong back in the
190.80s: kitchen Gordon was not happy with the
192.90s: amount of frozen food being used when
195.00s: was the last time we got fresh
195.90s: vegetables in the house
198.36s: last summer now I just cringe where I
200.88s: see that and that's all
204.36s: one shocking shortcut left Gordon in
207.18s: disbelief
210.84s: he took off the floor put in the fryer
212.82s: and then back in the sauce I'd never
214.92s: ever ever seen anything quite
216.84s: extraordinary as that yeah well the
219.60s: friar is going to uh
221.94s: it's going to take anything that's come
224.88s: off the floor underneath and that cleans
226.68s: it cleaned it bro sterilized sterilize
229.98s: it yeah
231.50s: [ __ ] me
234.68s: that night buddy the owner and Brian the
237.60s: chef nearly came to blows I'm not

251.28s: be here anymore I don't know if I wanted
253.08s: to be in the kitchen anymore never mind
254.64s: here
255.48s: get up out of here I'm done working here
257.40s: Brian reached his boiling point leaving
259.98s: Finn McCool's without a chef
264.96s: wasn't my son I'd have fired his ass out
267.60s: of here with nowhere else to turn buddy
271.04s: and Jason
275.82s: what the [ __ ] say we're left running in
277.80s: the kitchen and not doing a very good

287.16s: Brian was under you get a renewed
289.14s: respect for what Brian has to go through
291.06s: it's tough job all these times that I'm
293.52s: hard on my brother and we fight about
295.26s: stopping
296.58s: couldn't do what he does I wonder
298.32s: Brian's a cranky [ __ ]
300.30s: [Music]
304.38s: the next day Gordon gained valuable
306.90s: insight into the pressures Brian faced
309.30s: as parts of me that filthy in a way that
312.48s: I I started to understand what's on your
314.94s: shoulders
316.26s: have you thought about quitting and
317.94s: setting up elsewhere
320.70s: constantly yeah you could handle it a
323.28s: different way
324.36s: in a way that you become the responsible
327.06s: one okay thank you good man Chef Ramsay
330.96s: definitely kicked me in the ass got me
333.06s: excited to do what I'm doing
335.48s: the following day Gordon implemented

372.36s: was the menu the first thing I did was
374.52s: got rid of two-thirds of the menu
375.72s: because it wasn't fresh what's the point
377.16s: having on there Gordon even typed Brian
379.14s: his own family recipe for shepherd's pie
382.34s: to think that we are fortunate enough to
385.98s: be schooled by a man like Chef Ramsay or

850.22s: [Music]
851.84s: what a beautiful building what scares me
854.88s: is why no one's eating here I'm about to
857.04s: find out
858.06s: business at this upscale restaurant had
860.58s: ground to a halt there was Dean the
863.10s: cocky owner I don't believe there's a
864.84s: better operator or restaurateur than me
867.30s: who was desperate to succeed
871.38s: while Mike the chef had lost hope do I
874.62s: still have passion for food
877.08s: no Barbara Dean's wife was a nervous
880.62s: wreck this restaurant isn't just a
882.96s: restaurant it's our life it's our future
885.18s: it's our children's future
889.70s: six years ago Dean bought this 200 year
893.04s: old mill with the dream of turning it
895.08s: into a restaurant I have a reoccurring
897.72s: nightmare that I've had from day one
899.04s: what happens if I open up staffed up
901.68s: food ready and no one decides to come
904.32s: here what happened
905.88s: this year
908.71s: [Music]
913.76s: the guy's a winner his Michelin stars
916.56s: are like World Series rings he's got
918.18s: them but it didn't take long for Dean to
920.76s: change his tune about Gordon look at
922.98s: that what's that squashed into
925.58s: okay that's it there right that says I'm
929.64s: Tom was the chef a mechanic you know
932.22s: this is my house he was in my house and
934.14s: he was embarrassing me okay
937.96s: [Music]
940.92s: and it only got worse when Gordon tried
943.50s: one of the Specialties of the house it's
946.56s: gross look at it it looked like he'd
948.66s: come out of a baby's diaper honestly
951.12s: your food's crap I was pissed I wanted
955.32s: to take the plate and smash it on top of
957.30s: the chef's head
958.29s: [Music]
961.88s: after being wounded by Gordon's
964.32s: criticism of the food there was more
966.48s: pain when Gordon delved into the
968.28s: restaurant's finances
970.14s: are you aware of the current financial
971.76s: situation brother
974.22s: um he kind of keeps me in the dark a
976.14s: little bit I don't want her to worry if
978.78s: we
979.86s: had to close yeah tonight
982.44s: we'll be oh
985.10s: half a million half a million yeah got
989.70s: money tied up in the home
992.16s: mortgage wise oh sure I just choose not
994.74s: to deal with it right now I'll let him
996.42s: do it if the house gets taken away you
998.34s: lose that then every reason to be
999.96s: worried
1000.23s: [Music]
1003.68s: send bad food weren't the only problems
1006.26s: plaguing this restaurant okay
1009.22s: on weekends when the restaurant was busy
1012.08s: Dean tended to overstay his welcome at
1014.60s: the tables just okay just okay and in
1018.02s: the kitchen he seemed more concerned
1020.00s: about the speed of the cooking I need a
1021.98s: risotto on a tilapia that's done then
1023.84s: the quality got me very frustrated let
1026.24s: the customer away they waste 20 minutes
1027.80s: and he's happy or he weighs 20 minutes
1029.24s: gets crap what's worse does it make you
1032.12s: feel better if we rushed it to the table
1033.56s: no I'm amazed you don't want anything I
1037.46s: don't know I don't know what you I don't
1038.36s: know what you want me to say to you your
1039.50s: restaurant is on the ass
1043.10s: after a disappointing dinner service
1045.26s: Gordon confronted Dean over his lack of

1706.98s: [Music]
1709.70s: this once popular restaurant was on its
1712.70s: last legs and when it came to the food
1715.76s: Gordon had little if anything nice to
1718.52s: say about Billy's cooking zucchini
1720.98s: pancakes like having a mouthful of blue
1723.04s: it didn't blow me away today and it was
1725.96s: very sad end of story
1729.14s: Gordon noticed immediately that Billy
1731.84s: operated more like a line cook never
1733.94s: leaving the kitchen
1734.85s: [Music]
1740.66s: allowing manager Mike to run the
1742.94s: business into the ground I'm taking 50

1758.60s: of them go in the window at some point
1760.12s: where did you get all these from I have
1762.92s: a place they make them up for me

1788.06s: Gordon knew it was time to have a heart
1790.34s: to heart with Billy and Lisa I've got to
1793.04s: be [ __ ] brutally honest with you you
1794.84s: know that you seriously have to start
1796.94s: thinking as a businessman and then
1798.92s: watching you cooking you look like a man
1801.62s: that's dying to be put out of his misery
1803.36s: Lisa you may be right maybe we should
1806.06s: close this place down [ __ ] tonight
1808.90s: if the restaurant dies it'll be like a
1811.76s: death in the family

1850.10s: Mark in this competitive neighborhood
1851.84s: healthy is something that's not even
1853.82s: listed anywhere near here

1862.28s: to work in the kitchen Crea for your new
1864.38s: specials for the next dinner service
1867.34s: this is the kind of food that The Mixing
1870.56s: Bowl should be serving this is a poached
1873.26s: salmon top with a walnut pesto it's
1876.50s: exciting to realize you can do things

1892.28s: good we're selling the salmon good
1894.98s: but the front of the house was still
1897.20s: suffering from Mike's managerial style
1899.42s: is he working out all he does is stand
1901.34s: and talk and leave and pray
1904.22s: Kimmy you gotta work the tips baby it's
1907.04s: impossible to work with him and he takes
1909.44s: half of your tips you'll get five times
1911.30s: more pay than the servers what the hell
1912.98s: is your problem and in a post-dinner
1915.14s: meeting the staffs and Billy's wife
1917.36s: Lisa's frustration with Mike reached a
1920.00s: Breaking Point when I'm busting my own
1922.34s: tables and everybody else is running
1924.68s: around crazy we are aware of what the
1928.16s: problems were fighting for my life here

1934.70s: plate and make the changes every
1937.04s: freaking day every minute of the day
1938.90s: that's it
1940.58s: Billy that's the first time

2213.94s: 50.
2215.50s: the biggest lesson that I learned from
2217.30s: Gordon Ramsay was that people should
2220.12s: want to come to your restaurant you
2221.86s: shouldn't have to bribe them I actually
2224.38s: see the window's so clear no signs

2266.08s: think the most important thing Chef
2267.34s: Ramsay did to help out the restaurant
2268.90s: was
2269.98s: I think in me how are we doing on table
2271.90s: five and bringing me out into the
2273.46s: restaurant and start running the whole

2452.58s: Manhattan may be the mecca for great
2455.02s: restaurants but last year in the heart
2457.30s: of the Big Apple Gordon found his
2459.64s: biggest challenge ever there's one
2461.38s: restaurant that needs my help more than
2462.58s: any other and is right down there
2464.94s: Dylan's an Indian restaurant in Midtown

2508.24s: Indian does it
2510.60s: it didn't take long for Gordon to
2513.04s: realize he was facing a huge challenge
2518.38s: first off the menu wasn't even Indian
2520.54s: British Italian Buffalo yes anything is
2524.14s: not only here it's Chinese secondly and
2526.18s: more importantly the dishes were barely
2528.40s: edible there's two fritters they're both
2530.68s: vegetables yes
2532.31s: [Music]
2533.88s: there's meat in there

2580.60s: catastrophically wrong where'd you stop
2582.70s: on this one Gordon knew there was an
2585.16s: awful lot to do in a short amount of
2587.02s: time welcome but before he could start

2719.16s: and the kitchen is closed right now out

2725.14s: so outraged so angry from Green Burgers
2733.26s: I'm sorry to inform you that we are not
2736.06s: going to be serving dinner this evening
2737.76s: Chef Ramsey's shut down the kitchen
2741.06s: what do we need a death in the
2743.32s: restaurant before some [ __ ] gets the
2744.88s: grip
2747.04s: undeterred by the disgusting conditions
2749.38s: Gordon returned to the restaurant
2751.00s: equipped to deal with the mass
2752.92s: [Music]
2754.56s: with the help of professional steam
2756.94s: cleaners guys kissing straight through
2759.46s: there
2761.10s: Gordon and the staff of Dillons worked
2763.72s: through the night getting rid of all the
2766.12s: old rotten food and sterilizing every
2769.24s: square inch of the restaurant
2771.52s: in the days that followed Gordon's
2773.98s: design team dramatically changed the
2775.84s: decor
2777.46s: [Music]
2778.60s: Dylan's drab and dreary look take off
2781.54s: your blindfold was transformed into a
2783.88s: Sleek Contemporary Indian restaurant wow
2789.06s: haven't they done an amazing job this is
2791.68s: beautiful outside Gordon installed an
2794.14s: eye-catching awning revealing the
2795.94s: restaurant's new authentic Indian name
2797.98s: purnima
2800.56s: but the most critical change was
2802.72s: Gordon's decision to enlist one of New
2804.82s: York's top Indian chefs vikas Kana to
2807.94s: help make over the menu after the trio
2810.34s: we have the chicken korma the new menu
2812.86s: featured classic Indian dishes with a
2815.26s: modern twist
2817.54s: hello good evening on the night of the
2819.88s: relaunch with vikas in charge the
2822.22s: kitchen got off to a great start let's
2824.80s: go
2826.37s: [Music]
2829.90s: but unfortunately poor management
2832.42s: created chaos in the dining room
2835.72s: so that they want the lamb the ladies
2839.08s: that yeah the disorganization in the
2842.56s: dining room created confusion in the
2844.78s: kitchen who's running the restaurant and
2847.18s: customers were forced to suffer the
2848.74s: consequences
2853.02s: fed up with the Dismal service Gordon
2856.36s: asked floor manager Khan to step up be
2858.82s: honest with me can you manage this place
2861.28s: yes I can ready go ready everything is
2864.16s: ready
2865.60s: with vikas Manning the kitchen the staff

2869.88s: this is great and the opening was a
2872.50s: smashing success
2875.91s: [Music]
2877.42s: feeling that there was now hope for this
2879.58s: restaurant
2880.62s: please Gordon sat down with Muhammad for
2883.60s: a candid conversation about Martin this
2886.00s: is a new start you have to treat it as a
2888.88s: new beginning of course in a perfect
2890.44s: world I would sacrifice one of your
2892.36s: managers to employ Vehicles between you
2896.14s: and I Martin's not worth his weight in
2899.14s: terms of what he brings to the table
2900.28s: here in Gordon Ramsay saved up to
2902.74s: Muhammad that makes me upset and angry
2905.02s: I've never used who I've expected to I'm

3282.42s: southern Italy in a New Jersey suburb
3284.72s: one uh oh yesterday I'm on my own and a
3287.70s: restaurant on the brink of disaster
3290.06s: Mr Ramsey there was Joe the owner a
3293.46s: self-taught chef we don't have recipes
3295.44s: we don't use measuring cups or spoons
3297.24s: because I'm the best he ran a Carefree
3300.78s: kitchen you while the staff was goofing
3303.72s: around
3305.24s: it's like a big Romper Room back there
3308.04s: Joe was quickly going broke I owe my
3311.10s: purveyors about 80 000 right now in Cold
3313.62s: Hard Cash Joe's passion for big portions
3316.26s: was eating up his profits I can't see us
3318.90s: going on another year his wife was
3320.82s: distraught it takes a lot of courage and
3324.42s: his mom a nervous wreck I'd worry about
3326.82s: Joe I worry about stress level I worry
3328.92s: about Melissa I worry about the boys the
3331.32s: cash crunch took its toll these are not
3333.78s: working ovens and the customers paid the
3336.48s: price we've been here since seven
3338.22s: o'clock we need your specials now that
3340.14s: [ __ ] everyone else but clearly
3341.82s: compania's biggest problem was its food
3345.24s: garlic everywhere big big chunks you all
3348.24s: want to go back to the office without
3349.20s: breath would you
3351.12s: probably mackerel it's like a bison's
3353.52s: tongue
3356.04s: the food I think is pure and honest and
3358.50s: good I think it was a mistake that I did
3360.60s: this
3363.02s: in the first dinner service Gordon
3365.52s: noticed doggy bags on nearly every table
3368.12s: what's wrong with her nothing is wrong
3370.56s: with it they're taking it away oh my God
3373.32s: he knew Joe's huge portions made food
3375.66s: costs astronomical unbelievable and
3378.60s: would eventually Force Joe out of
3380.22s: business
3381.08s: sit down sit down I've never seen such
3384.78s: humongous portions
3387.12s: why did you decide to go into business

3391.44s: business talk to me no you're getting

3402.54s: have this conversation downstairs how
3404.04s: about that yeah you're embarrassing me
3405.36s: in front of my customers
3409.20s: frustrated by Joe's stubbornness the
3411.78s: next morning Gordon decided to visit his
3413.88s: wife Melissa to get a better insight
3415.98s: into Joe I
3418.62s: thank you a lot of pressure on Joe's
3421.62s: shoulders um how do you think he's doing

3431.94s: People Like Us put everything on the
3433.56s: line for a Dream

3450.08s: determined to help Joe and his family
3452.22s: Gordon went right back to work this menu
3455.58s: is far too big for his own good I don't
3458.10s: understand what's going through his mind
3459.12s: to have this fridge stock with all these
3460.98s: ingredients and no customers to cook for
3462.78s: little bag after bag after bag this is
3466.86s: where his eighty thousand dollars debt

3473.34s: [ __ ] walking in a completely
3474.72s: different light I went holy [ __ ]
3479.10s: Gordon's next step in turning compania
3481.38s: around was retraining the cooking staff
3483.48s: from prep to presentation I know it's
3485.76s: rusting but at least make sure that we
3487.44s: got a little bit of pride in what we're
3488.52s: doing you can do better then Gordon came
3490.92s: up with one menu item that would
3492.66s: separate Campagna from all the other

3667.44s: that seriously wanted to give up and
3668.88s: every member of staff for far more
3670.20s: interest than the good laugh as opposed

3724.92s: just turned around on a dime completely
3726.54s: the influx of customers is nearly
3728.52s: doubled and and that's due to Gordon
3730.68s: before I go in the dining room have a
3731.82s: quick peek in the walk-in yeah come on I
3733.92s: don't understand what's going through
3734.82s: his mind to have this fridge stop with
3736.74s: all these ingredients and no customers
3738.30s: to cook for take a gander enough for the
3741.00s: next couple of days maximum there's
3742.98s: nowhere near the amount of poisoning no
3744.48s: I mean we were stacked for the Raptors
3746.10s: before in in food alone we're saving
3748.56s: about five thousand dollars a month that
3750.48s: equates about sixty thousand dollars a
3752.28s: year we've got so much of a financial
3754.08s: cushion I can finally pay my purveyors
3756.60s: on time they really helped me out so
3758.52s: it's just been nothing short of a I
3760.14s: think a small miracle I almost feel
3761.70s: guilty about how you know how good it's
3763.92s: been for me before Gordon was here we
3766.02s: were pretty close to to the edge
3767.52s: financially it's been spectacular but
3769.38s: the hardest part for me was watching my
3770.70s: wife go through it because she didn't
3772.08s: sign up for it I did you look so much
3773.82s: more confident now because last time we
3775.26s: met and we had that chant it was pretty
3777.42s: hard on you yeah hardest thing for me is
3780.42s: that people like us put everything on
3782.16s: the line for a dream yeah how'd you go
3784.80s: now
3786.18s: I mean you really gave him a Fighting
3788.16s: Chance you know I just think Gordon
3789.60s: Ramsay is so inspiring you know I
3791.16s: respect him for coming in here and being
3792.54s: honest and
3793.80s: letting my husband know what he needs to

3798.06s: know they are it's been great it's so
3799.74s: nice to see you sounding and looking so

3803.40s: support you give him is just the
3805.92s: foundation to the success of this place
3807.60s: so don't stop okay yeah good to see him
3810.30s: you too but it's important for me to see
3812.58s: my husband succeed this is what he wants

3855.84s: downstairs you came in you know gave me
3858.18s: like low after blow yeah and I took it
3859.92s: pretty bad you know ironically I think
3862.08s: that that was a really in retrospect a
3864.06s: pretty clever way of
3866.64s: just batting me down so much that I just
3869.46s: was able to really to look at myself
3870.96s: objectively and to really see my flaws I
3873.30s: think nobody could have done that but a
3874.98s: guy like Gordon smaller place is it
3876.90s: working yeah yeah I mean the customer
3880.14s: doesn't feel like they're getting any
3881.04s: less you know they're just not taking

4669.08s: class town on the North Shore of Long
4671.00s: Island
4672.68s: inhabited by the working class Kent City
4675.92s: commuters with no shortage of trendy
4678.80s: eateries
4680.36s: and then there's the handlebar hello
4682.94s: handlebar how can I help you build Leroy
4685.28s: of former construction worker and his
4686.90s: wife Carolyn bought the handlebar just
4688.94s: one year ago oh boy The Handlebar is a
4692.48s: really nice place and what I saw it was
4694.52s: for sale I jumped on it in our specials
4696.98s: menu when we came into the handlebar we
4699.74s: saw that it had been run down
4702.44s: but Billy being so handsy now they're on
4706.16s: we saw the potential of having a great
4709.76s: place
4711.52s: and it's Heyday this was the place to be
4714.44s: this was the place that the judges came
4716.00s: this is the place that the lawyers came
4717.44s: the doctors came
4719.06s: now it's not like that anymore the
4722.00s: nightmare began when 70 of the money was
4724.76s: coming from the bar and almost nothing
4726.32s: was coming from the dining room
4728.42s: when you can't turn 18 tables on a
4731.42s: Friday or a Saturday night you're in a
4733.46s: lot of trouble
4735.74s: bill is an okay manager can I bother you
4739.16s: to make me a cup of coffee Billy usually
4741.02s: stays at the bar but being an owner he
4743.84s: has to be more involved
4747.08s: like answer the phone somebody on the
4749.00s: phone sometimes he can be very grouchy
4751.28s: now go put all the stuff back we've got
4753.26s: it then I feel like his mood swings
4755.36s: change I've had it with these people
4760.58s: this place is gross like dirt filth that
4764.18s: had been built up over the past 20 years
4767.42s: the interior it looks dated
4770.84s: the decor
4773.26s: I think it's great
4776.42s: the core menu is basically the same as I
4779.12s: inherited with the restaurant they look
4780.92s: disgusting I don't know why anybody
4782.60s: orders them Melissa is an excellent Chef
4786.32s: I'm not a chef I don't claim to be a
4788.96s: chef I don't want to be a chef I not
4791.72s: very creative
4793.58s: five minutes
4795.02s: the food is
4796.70s: crap
4799.00s: I think hiring me wasn't necessarily the
4802.10s: best idea I don't even know what I'm
4803.78s: doing here I don't intend for it to be
4805.70s: my career
4806.90s: I really don't think militia has any
4809.00s: weaknesses as a cook
4812.30s: the day we call it quits is the day we
4815.12s: have not one penny to put into this
4817.70s: place we took out equity line of credit
4820.28s: that's almost maxed out and drains our
4823.28s: savings account God help us if the
4826.46s: handlebar fails we'd risk losing our
4828.92s: house then I never want to lose my house
4831.56s: we need to worry about you and me in The
4833.84s: Handlebar bottom line if Chef Ramsay
4836.78s: doesn't come here our time is very
4839.78s: limited I definitely don't think it's
4842.42s: another year

5172.78s: restaurant otherwise he wouldn't be here
5174.76s: oh my God what a disaster disaster
5181.62s: no it's not
5186.00s: after an underwhelming first meal okay
5189.34s: pulled together Gordon realizes that the
5191.80s: owners and the chef are oblivious to the
5193.96s: restaurant's real problems what's wrong
5196.12s: with the business it's test room as you
5198.64s: see it and we can't fill 18 tables on a
5200.68s: Friday night
5201.94s: that's the problem
5203.92s: no the problem here is the food
5207.70s: the food's bad Bill
5209.50s: I never really had complaints about the
5211.84s: food so that was never really an area of
5213.76s: concern to me when the fondue arrived
5216.34s: and that's just a joke I don't enjoy the
5218.32s: fondue either but you're the chef on you
5220.12s: you're the one that's yeah you're you're
5222.22s: running it as the head chef right that
5224.50s: that's the intent so change it
5227.68s: I don't know what to do about it have
5230.62s: you lost your passion I never had a
5232.60s: passion to begin with
5236.74s: I don't want to be a chef
5240.94s: I was really shocked that that's the way
5242.92s: she felt so you're not a chef no
5245.74s: I had applications for the job here as a
5248.50s: chef when she approached me and said
5250.36s: would you give me the opportunity I mean
5252.10s: you don't ask for that opportunity if
5253.96s: you don't care what you're doing why did

5257.26s: chef the other guy was going out and I
5259.06s: was here

5272.32s: having exposed Melissa's apathy in the
5274.72s: kitchen
5277.00s: Gordon observes a dinner service to find
5279.04s: out how her attitude is affecting the
5281.08s: food
5281.41s: [Music]
5286.06s: I know he was here to help but it's

5402.76s: up with the orders
5404.46s: the customers are still not satisfied
5410.94s: and Gordon needs Billy to finally
5413.56s: understand that the food is handlebar's
5415.90s: biggest problem Billy customers are
5418.12s: complaining about the food
5420.30s: you can't walk around oblivious the fact
5423.82s: that you think this is good yeah but
5425.98s: it's not bad in everybody's opinion
5429.72s: you can't take care of everybody's taste
5432.94s: buds something that some people like

5447.10s: truthfully you've accepted it oh
5450.10s: absolutely not I was kind of really
5451.84s: disappointed I I knew we needed help I
5454.42s: didn't think we were that bad I was
5456.70s: quite skeptical about his intentions
5459.30s: whatever
5461.46s: really starting to dislike him
5463.94s: [Music]
5467.70s: after witnessing last night's pathetic

5478.90s: Porsches taken out that's Dreadful

5483.52s: vegetables because the chef can't be
5484.84s: bothered to cook fresh broccoli
5487.18s: the reminiscence of Exxon Valdez
5490.42s: oh my god when was the last time the
5493.24s: back of the fridge was clean and you
5495.04s: look at it what is that in there oh my
5498.58s: God almighty
5503.20s: that there was a clam oh what a mess
5508.48s: state of the fridge Melissa got two
5510.28s: minutes has only confirmed Gordon's
5512.20s: belief that the restaurant lacks true
5514.00s: passion and Leadership so you're in
5516.58s: charge of the kitchen and the general
5517.66s: hygiene you're supposed to be yes
5521.74s: why is it in a mess
5522.99s: [Music]
5525.58s: it's 100 times cleaner than it was six
5527.38s: months ago sure it was okay when was the
5530.14s: last time you had a little wipe down
5531.58s: there or uh in here just just that I've
5535.42s: never done my God
5537.60s: unbelievable oh
5540.52s: this is embarrassing
5544.00s: that usually doesn't matter right okay
5546.76s: I'm glad you're starting to make excuses
5548.74s: for it yeah
5550.12s: if you thought this was bad have a look
5552.52s: at this Chef Ramsey seemed to feel that
5555.16s: I was making excuses for everything and
5557.44s: really had no idea of the past practices
5560.44s: that had gone on here
5562.48s: okay last night we served frozen
5564.16s: vegetables to a customer and we've got
5566.08s: two boxes of broccoli there you know I
5568.12s: can't do it all that's it you were happy
5569.86s: to serve frozen broccoli over fresh
5572.32s: broccoli I'm trying to open up your eyes
5574.60s: Billy and explain to you you know what
5576.76s: the current situation is when was the
5578.98s: last time this fridge was cleaned a week
5580.96s: ago oh come on this hasn't been cleaned
5583.72s: in yet no no no it hasn't I'm sorry 21

5589.84s: [ __ ] dollar I have this [ __ ] place
5591.94s: hasn't been cleaned in years
5594.10s: I'm disgusted put your hand down there
5596.98s: you still never did bend down and touch
5598.84s: it it was a big thing of denial for him
5601.00s: I'll take responsibility for the fact
5603.22s: that I haven't changed it but it's not
5604.54s: all my fault you know everything's
5606.88s: coming out and this place is going to
5608.56s: get cleaned I wish you'd give me a
5610.54s: little more credit for cleaning it up as
5612.40s: much as I had so far it looks 60 70
5615.28s: times better than it used to look in
5617.44s: here it's really that's disgusting no
5621.04s: it's it's not fine we've got a big
5622.78s: problem when was the last time that

5644.68s: credit or uh pat on the back to things
5647.92s: that were done
5650.28s: unfucking believable so that just proves
5652.66s: and confirms how weak this guy is he's
5654.82s: not running this place this place is
5656.44s: running a hymn and it's in need of a
5658.18s: [ __ ] serious clean that is appalling
5664.50s: prompted by Gordon's shocking Discovery
5667.18s: Melissa enlists the wait staff to do a
5669.70s: thorough cleaning what do you use to
5671.44s: clean the pollution soap
5673.66s: it's disgusting I really wish I had a
5677.02s: mask on me right now
5679.30s: Philly
5682.18s: two seconds in
5684.82s: I was hoping he was going to tell me I
5686.62s: understand Billy that this isn't your
5688.12s: fault but it really needs to be taken
5689.80s: care of so let's take care of it
5692.26s: I'm [ __ ] pissed off
5694.66s: and I'm upset on the kind of [ __ ] that

5718.84s: get rid of everybody in the restaurant
5719.92s: I'll do it all myself great idea and
5721.72s: then when it doesn't work out and then
5723.22s: when I drop dead because I [ __ ] sleep
5725.32s: two hours a day then maybe it'll get
5728.02s: done or maybe who cares once you're dead

6171.60s: I can honestly say that I love my wife
6173.94s: more than anything in this world so I
6176.10s: came back here for my wife while Billy
6178.62s: tries to reconnect with his restaurant I
6181.26s: need my food Melissa struggles to give
6183.66s: the wait staff complete orders I ran
6185.88s: half the [ __ ] order I need the rest
6187.38s: of it and there's a lot of problems
6188.88s: who's this for here Melissa that's been
6190.86s: here 37 minutes I don't know the creeps
6194.34s: I forgot half of it so
6197.04s: Melissa just stop communicating I mean
6199.56s: that's just how Melissa is and I think
6201.90s: that's when we ran into problems are any
6204.18s: of my Foods coming out for any of my
6205.74s: table I have no idea
6214.07s: [Music]
6216.24s: so now in the weeds so much I really
6218.04s: couldn't tell who was waiting and was
6219.66s: wanting I need
6223.80s: it got very flustered back there this
6226.56s: place was total chaos it's nine o'clock
6229.52s: 5 30. I just don't know what to say with
6233.16s: the orders backed up in the kitchen
6234.66s: Kelly whatever God help us
6238.86s: impatient hungry customers begin taking
6241.26s: out their frustrations
6243.02s: on each other you know we're just
6245.64s: talking about before you open up your
6247.44s: mouth I can open up my mouth
6250.86s: talking to my parents this way that's so
6254.64s: ridiculous it's a total disaster and uh
6257.94s: I really think I'm to the point now that
6259.74s: I don't know what else to do come on can
6262.20s: we talk about it yeah Billy has no
6264.96s: choice but to listen to Chef Ramsay
6266.94s: because if he won't listen then we might
6268.44s: as well just shut the doors and walk
6270.18s: away right now I have never ever ever
6273.12s: seen my kitchen fall apart like that
6275.52s: ever
6276.66s: ever on our busiest nights never have I
6280.56s: seen that
6282.00s: Melissa has to talk now this is the most
6284.10s: crucial stage of the service where she
6285.72s: has to open up and and talk and get help
6288.06s: from there and get help let's just
6289.50s: delegate with so many tables on the man
6291.48s: is one of the top chefs in the world and
6294.54s: maybe I should um put aside the ill
6298.14s: feelings and listen to what he asked to
6300.66s: say Melissa may not be communicating but
6302.82s: the menu is faster
6305.04s: yeah
6306.90s: I see what you're saying at that point I
6309.60s: was very open-minded to his ideas
6311.18s: seriously I'm pleased you're back yeah I
6313.56s: you're the you're the foundation of this
6315.12s: place we have a little chat with the
6316.26s: staff because I think they would like to
6317.70s: hear that we're all on the same track
6321.72s: the first hour of service was amazing
6324.54s: and then we got backed up we got backed
6327.18s: up bad Melissa you refused to
6329.46s: communicate I didn't know what the [ __ ]
6330.90s: was going on yeah I agree with you
6332.70s: honestly this menu has to come down yes
6335.58s: that has to be condensed it'd be
6337.02s: appreciated new small Dynamic menu a
6340.50s: menu that we can push out it's gonna be

7043.52s: little bit
7044.24s: congratulations on being Long Island's
7046.70s: first Gastropub
7050.80s: okay good night
7054.38s: Chef Ramsay came to my restaurant went
7058.16s: above and beyond anything I could have
7060.68s: possibly asked for and I know this
7063.38s: restaurant's going to be successful from
7065.54s: here on out
7066.78s: [Music]
7071.54s: for days we made a lot of changes change
7073.46s: the menu change the decor but there's
7075.56s: one thing in there that I thought was
7077.12s: completely unchangeable
7079.16s: and that was Bill
7080.48s: and we even managed that
7082.49s: [Music]
7086.00s: 30 miles north of Detroit lies the
7088.52s: township of Macomb County home to
7090.80s: Giuseppe's its owners Joe Borgia and his
7093.68s: wife Kathy have owned several successful
7096.02s: Italian restaurants in the span of 25
7097.94s: years
7099.20s: after retiring they decided to open
7101.48s: Giuseppes with the dream of passing it
7103.88s: down to their son Sam I opened it with
7106.28s: the expectations that we would put Sam
7108.80s: on his feet and Joe and I could just go
7111.08s: to Florida or wherever but it just
7113.18s: hasn't worked out that way Sam basically
7115.46s: said Dad I want to step up to the plate
7117.98s: I want to work day and night you and Mom
7119.72s: can come a little better at a time but
7121.76s: when we started working 20 hours a week
7124.46s: to me it was like another empty promise
7126.74s: you want to go get your son because
7128.60s: every time we I try to explain he's got
7130.34s: to walk away Sam did you walk off the
7133.10s: line no it's a nightmare for two reasons
7136.28s: the lack of customers and the hell that
7139.52s: goes out in the kitchen when you're
7141.68s: serving Frozen [ __ ] salmon I mean no
7143.60s: matter what you do you can boil it in
7145.46s: grease no it's still going to be talking
7146.96s: that's probably wrong you proved me
7148.64s: wrong then I'm not supposed to have no
7150.86s: input I'm not supposed to be able to
7152.72s: change anything usually people roast
7154.52s: them on the barbecue no that's the way
7156.14s: you do it I'm just supposed to basically
7158.00s: be a shadow and some money that he can
7160.10s: just say it's your fault okay Dan
7161.60s: whatever you say I'm Brian I'm a truck
7164.18s: driver but I Chef here part-time right
7166.52s: here Joe I've known Joe for forever he's
7169.22s: getting up there a little bit in years
7170.30s: and he's just he's getting tired and I
7172.64s: don't think that his son is stepping up
7174.32s: to the plate
7176.08s: I'm not and you're just gonna push him
7178.04s: in too many hours they're not pushing
7179.54s: you you're pushing you I'm a diabetic
7181.88s: some days I don't feel like coming in
7183.92s: some days I can't even roll out of bed
7185.90s: but I have to be here that's my
7188.48s: responsibility my sugar is low I'm
7191.24s: [ __ ] up here okay I got it my dad's
7194.96s: house is not good by any standards it's
7198.20s: the most heartbreaking thing to see I
7201.02s: just want my family to be healthy and
7203.06s: happy everything else doesn't matter if
7206.00s: anybody can help our family who would

9710.88s: I wouldn't open a [ __ ] Italian
9712.44s: restaurant without working in one
9714.72s: I definitely think Anthony needs to hear
9716.40s: that he's arrogant because I say to him
9718.62s: sometimes and he takes it as oh yeah you
9720.84s: know what you're talking about I'm
9722.22s: gobsmacked that a young man at the age
9724.86s: of 25 would manipulate his future father

9728.34s: having never worked in a [ __ ] Italian
9730.32s: restaurant
9731.58s: that doesn't make sense not offense I

9737.34s: restaurant he's got the house now
9740.22s: Chef Ramsay was you know making me feel

9743.46s: ain't doing too well I have enough
9745.08s: pressure as it is you guys are
9746.70s: struggling to get married and you've

10617.12s: of humility you know that
10624.20s: to move forward yeah Chef Ramsay taught
10627.08s: me you need to face reality you need to
10629.72s: realize that maybe you're not the only

11900.88s: wow amazing I've seen many a dream turn
11904.12s: into a nightmare tonight a nightmare
11906.58s: turned into a beautiful dream
11909.53s: [Music]
11911.64s: New York City restaurant capital of the
11915.34s: world home to thousands of restaurants
11917.38s: vying to be the Crown Jewel of the city
11921.06s: the Black Pearl just being one
11925.18s: started by two friends as a small
11927.40s: downtown Lobster Shack they moved to
11929.86s: Midtown added a third partner and hoped
11933.04s: to become the premier Lobster restaurant
11935.02s: in Manhattan I suggested to Brian that
11938.08s: we put an ad in the paper to find an
11940.48s: investor since we didn't want to spend
11942.88s: any of our own money ordering two hot
11944.74s: lobster rolls I met Craig and thought
11946.84s: that he would be a perfect match
11948.28s: gentlemen fish and chips it was David's
11950.86s: concept and I thought the concept was
11952.84s: really very good and I thought would
11954.16s: make some pretty good money did we get
11955.78s: that 2500 because I'm about four grand
11958.48s: short of payroll the problem started
11960.52s: when we started to run low on money it
11962.68s: became very frustrating around here
11964.06s: Brian and Greg and I stopped speaking we
11966.16s: would try to communicate by email text
11968.20s: messaging and everybody got nervous and
11970.12s: frustrated this place is a nightmare for
11972.40s: the lack of management we don't have one
11975.22s: voice I just asked Brian he's like yeah
11977.74s: well you guys can figure it out can we
11979.54s: always figure it out well I know because
11981.34s: they don't know what to do I think
11983.32s: Brian's more of a silent partner if he
11985.36s: Choice he'd probably just not have to
11988.00s: work here at all this table had a hair
11991.84s: in their fries I don't want to deal with
11994.42s: this you deal with this Greg is the
11996.46s: hardest working owner but he doesn't
11998.26s: make a decision who the [ __ ] put these
12000.36s: letters on here I couldn't tell you out
12003.18s: of the three owners I like David at
12004.74s: least because his ego tends to get in
12006.66s: the way of a healthy atmosphere don't
12009.00s: touch the tickets Please the main
12010.86s: problem with the black pearl is these
12013.20s: guys are really stubborn and if Gordon
12014.88s: Ramsay can help us all kind of mesh
12016.98s: together then this place can be
12018.60s: phenomenal
12022.22s: New York City one of the most difficult
12024.66s: places ever to open a restaurant I open
12026.88s: mine 14 months ago and I've been busting
12028.68s: my balls ever since I'm dying to see how
12030.78s: the Black Pearl are doing
12032.95s: [Music]
12042.19s: [Music]
12049.22s: desperately need Gordon's help we need
12052.02s: him to come in and kind of whip all of
12054.06s: the owners into shave how's business
12055.62s: could be better but we're three owners
12057.96s: and all three have been over the

12336.30s: after tasting the supposedly best food
12339.00s: on the menu how are you Gordon gathers
12341.64s: the three owners and head chef Phil who
12344.46s: oversees the food I do the award-winning
12347.04s: lobster roll bread soggy Lobster blend
12350.28s: do not seasoned salt pepper when you
12351.90s: bind it with mayonnaise no no why not
12354.12s: well we get most of our recipes and
12356.52s: ideas from Maine and it's not the way
12358.50s: it's done they have salt in Maine I've
12360.36s: I've lived in Maine for three months I
12361.80s: know it very well Chef Ramsay didn't
12363.78s: like our lobster roll and he said he's
12365.28s: lived in Maine for three months but if
12366.78s: he'd lived in Maine for three months
12367.98s: he'd know that a lobster roll is exactly
12370.20s: the way we make it I'm really nervous
12372.42s: now I've never known a chef that's not
12374.22s: allowed to season his food is this
12375.78s: manual Chef or is he your puppet
12378.18s: no he's my chef David has this tone of
12381.54s: being condescending and
12383.82s: knowing it all how much debt have we
12385.80s: gotten over the house quarter Mill yeah
12388.32s: yeah who has the final say if one of us
12391.26s: presents an idea we vote on it and we
12393.00s: decide whether we want to go forward
12394.02s: with it or not is it hard running a
12395.40s: business with three Partners it's hard
12397.20s: for us yeah what was the last time all
12398.70s: three of you sat down we have not we
12400.62s: have not done so okay I don't feel so
12405.18s: that any of you are committed to making
12407.64s: this work have you fallen out oh yeah a
12410.46s: couple of three times yeah so that's why
12411.60s: we don't meet yeah okay who fell out
12413.70s: with who I get mad at them why uh
12416.88s: because I don't think they're doing what
12417.66s: they need to do and we feel exactly the
12420.30s: same about him of course yeah
12422.70s: I felt that Gordon was right about many
12425.70s: things but I think he jumped to
12427.44s: conclusions and that we are not
12429.00s: committed to Black Pearl
12430.80s: arrested and run by three passenger
12432.54s: owners no chance Ryan he works two days
12434.88s: a week David Wilm I don't trust him one
12437.28s: little inch and that's for Greg well
12439.32s: he's pissed off with both of them
12440.70s: basically in a nutshell sleepy Dopey and
12443.88s: grumpy who am I there's no [ __ ] white
12448.62s: after a frustrating conversation with
12451.08s: the owners Chef Ramsay decides to take a
12453.84s: look at how the Black Pearl operates
12455.58s: during a dinner service especially on a
12458.16s: night that all three owners are there
12464.60s: that's really good I promise ordering
12468.18s: two hot lobster rolls where's that Fisk
12470.10s: Phil call me right now David I got a
12471.90s: crab cakes getting cold two lobster
12473.58s: rolls and a fried shrimp to beef the
12475.08s: shrimp roll's not ready yet what
12477.12s: happened with that I don't have a fried
12478.02s: chicken french fries so when you and
12480.06s: Brian are here together on the same day
12481.38s: Brian takes care of them we're never
12482.64s: here together
12483.80s: yeah it was weird having David in here
12486.12s: expedited because he doesn't normally do
12487.62s: that and having someone on this side of
12489.36s: the line that knows what they're doing
12490.26s: is key we have one more crab cake no no
12492.36s: you sold the last one oh that's it we
12494.28s: don't have it
12496.10s: oh my God that's cool
12499.22s: how are you guys doing I believe this
12502.32s: made me rule
12510.02s: I need an order of fried shrimp this one
12512.94s: was on the cooked what are you kidding
12515.88s: me David's lack of experience on the
12518.46s: past is resulting in lack of quality
12520.80s: control they wanted these two well done
12522.54s: zap them unfucking believe me what's
12525.24s: that four [ __ ] ups already with them I
12526.98s: think it was a competition amongst the
12528.36s: three owners to try and prove team Chef
12530.52s: Ramsay that they know what they were
12531.78s: doing and I thought Greg kind of felt
12533.70s: out of his element because he's normally
12534.96s: in the kitchen I'll take this back
12538.64s: okay thank you we got sand in the
12541.86s: muscles it's supposed to be Santa's
12543.60s: humors that's about to get a [ __ ] bra
12544.92s: I don't know people don't know what the
12546.60s: [ __ ] they're ordering what are they
12547.50s: ordering David definitely a know-it-all
12549.42s: and he can be a little rude what table
12552.78s: is that table eight
12556.16s: hi you had the uh climb back and there
12559.98s: was a problem with the muscles or the
12562.02s: Steamers so they're terribly sent yeah
12564.42s: there should be Sanders here there often
12566.04s: is and that's why you have the broth to
12567.48s: dip them in what would you like instead
12569.04s: of those uh nothing in fact I'll just
12571.08s: eat the lobster okay it'll be right out
12573.80s: we just reprimanded I do not think that
12576.84s: Chef Ramsay likes David because Chef
12579.78s: Ramsay has a [ __ ] detector and David
12583.44s: could be full of it sometimes
12591.56s: that's the funny fish and chips I've
12593.64s: ever seen in my life you know
12595.62s: what happened
12596.88s: I just smell inside there will you
12598.56s: please Phil two seconds
12601.34s: [Music]
12603.98s: what do you smell Phil it smells old why
12607.02s: didn't they eat it I don't know Gordon
12608.88s: yeah do you ever ask yourself that
12610.02s: question I don't I asked myself that
12611.40s: question all the time I suppose you
12612.54s: actually don't give a [ __ ] you know that
12613.98s: I do give a [ __ ] because you know I give
12615.48s: a [ __ ] you seem a very relaxed man with
12617.52s: your rest what do you want me to do I
12619.08s: disagree it doesn't smell bad to me the
12620.70s: fish I've just given a piece to your
12622.26s: Chef yeah the piece was stinking it
12624.72s: wasn't stinking you're blind my friend
12626.64s: no if you're not blind you're [ __ ]
12628.86s: clueless you know that
12632.24s: now the owner said it's not stinking
12634.68s: it's fragrant fresh and perfect that's
12637.44s: why it came back right massage is ego
12642.60s: concerned about the quality control of
12644.88s: the food yeah show me around and the
12646.86s: truthfulness of the owner Gordon wants
12649.44s: to do a little investigating they're all
12651.60s: for mine these are uh me and some from
12654.54s: Canada they look Canadian lobsters to me
12656.52s: yeah these are Canadians
12658.38s: so the Canadian lobsters are always a
12660.66s: lot cheaper I use the Canadian lobsters
12662.76s: for raviolis and taglitellies and
12665.04s: spaghetti but they're not main lobsters
12668.97s: [Music]
12675.96s: after a disappointing dinner service
12678.00s: comes to an end Gordon is ready to share
12680.64s: some of his initial observations tough
12683.10s: day today and I'm um I'm deeply
12686.22s: concerned I see a ship here that is
12688.98s: rudderless and maybe that was the first
12691.62s: time that all three of you were working
12693.48s: inside this restaurant in a long time
12696.90s: tonight showed when was the last time
12699.42s: you expedited all the time I'm back
12701.52s: there you were you're not really back
12703.20s: there as much as you went back there no
12704.58s: not never because there's never been
12705.78s: that we've never had the whole lineup
12707.16s: the whole line with tickets ever David
12709.50s: can you stop being a slippery eel for 15
12711.96s: minutes in front of your team and answer
12714.36s: the [ __ ] truth important the [ __ ]
12716.46s: truth is that I'm back there when it's
12717.90s: busy every [ __ ] night that I work I
12719.88s: think a lot of what Chef Ramsay's had to
12721.32s: say about David was fairly true I don't
12723.54s: believe that David shows that he cares
12725.54s: okay I've seen enough today I've got to
12728.82s: go and start really seriously [ __ ]
12731.10s: understanding you know how to get a
12733.08s: direction within this restaurant
12736.86s: I'll see you first thing in the morning
12738.48s: good night uh David yeah you tell me
12742.14s: about the passion with the main lobster
12744.42s: are you aware that the lobsters in your
12746.34s: fridge are Canadian
12748.26s: same water as North Atlantic Waters
12750.92s: you're telling me now a Canadian Lobster
12753.60s: half a private main lobster is the same
12755.88s: taste and flavor there's a big
12758.28s: difference
12761.94s: I can't get Maine Lobsters that's right
12764.16s: so they get them I'm using Canadians
12766.38s: that's right that's what they do but I
12767.76s: don't advertise them as Maine tell me is
12770.10s: it a different animal Mei is a Canadian
12773.16s: lobster for you a Martis Americana same
12775.50s: animal right holy [ __ ] I'm asking you a
12777.72s: question what you're trying to dictate
12779.70s: to me is that you're selling Maine
12781.32s: Lobster they're not from Maine well it
12783.66s: comes from the same then
12785.48s: holy [ __ ] the award-winning Maine
12789.66s: lobster roll it's Canadian he was wrong
12793.20s: about the lobster issues it pissed me
12796.26s: off I thought that was a bit unfair for
12797.64s: him to take that stand and especially
12799.14s: since he was incorrect about it I'll see
12801.24s: in the morning good night
12806.10s: that was fun
12807.48s: incredible
12812.70s: it's a new day and Gordon has organized
12815.52s: a staff meeting how are we good a rarity
12817.92s: here at Black Pearl as there have not
12820.02s: been any meetings in the last seven
12822.06s: months okay
12823.68s: a quick exercise so I want to find out
12826.14s: how you feel we're gonna write anonymous
12829.20s: questions when you write make sure you
12832.20s: put the name you want the question to at
12835.08s: the top of it fold it up and put it
12836.88s: straight in the pot
12838.14s: okay Greg how come you waffle with your
12842.22s: answers well basically I try to keep
12844.44s: everybody happy because otherwise I
12846.84s: wouldn't have a staff and that's why I
12848.64s: sometimes waffle and go back and forth
12850.26s: but if you had a little bit stricter
12852.80s: philosophy yeah I could definitely be
12854.88s: restricted oh yeah I could definitely be
12856.20s: stricter thanks for being honest okay
12858.30s: David why haven't we got aprons they
12861.84s: know where the aprons are they just
12863.04s: don't choose to wear them but why can't
12864.84s: you say it's policy to be in an apron
12867.24s: Kat it's policy for you not to have a
12869.34s: drink here after your shift but you
12870.72s: often do
12871.89s: [Music]
12873.48s: can't you ask my question without a
12876.06s: question I did answer your question
12881.46s: it is
12885.36s: so
12887.52s: okay with him can be very frustrating
12889.14s: David share the girls and respectfully
12892.38s: the great of beating around the bush you
12893.88s: know that well ah
12895.98s: in front of everybody why can't you
12897.66s: answer the [ __ ] question
12899.58s: I thought I did answer the question
12900.66s: rather than trying to be such a smart
12902.10s: ass and asking about the question of the
12903.78s: question you know what I've just
12904.74s: discovered you're so full of [ __ ]
12906.72s: [ __ ] you'd make a great politician you
12908.34s: know that David has the biggest ego he's
12910.74s: very stubborn and obviously you're not
12912.90s: doing everything correct so get over
12914.40s: yourself and allow somebody to help you
12916.46s: incredible I'm [ __ ] surprised you've
12919.26s: got anybody working for you and the last
12921.66s: half hour you'll look so so cool as if
12923.94s: you don't give a [ __ ] it's disgusting
12929.48s: and finally it's all three owners why
12933.06s: don't we have one general manager what
12937.14s: are they crying out for Greg right you

12958.02s: but now I have to follow through and do
12960.00s: it I think Brian and David will get on
12962.58s: board I'm going to get some fresh air

13389.68s: Australia have fragmented this business
13392.48s: David isn't it best that we listen to
13395.12s: the team for that cry of help rather
13397.88s: than having to massage your own egos I
13399.98s: think Greg would be a perfect general
13401.36s: manager yeah but it is full of [ __ ] I've
13403.82s: heard him say many times that Greg has
13405.80s: no idea what he's doing in a restaurant

13412.10s: you all for being honest thank you
13418.58s: well one thing's clear that the staff
13420.56s: want Greg to run this place even David
13422.78s: wants Greg to run it so that's good news

14262.30s: personally I've got mixed feelings about
14263.50s: this week because I so want this to
14265.30s: succeed for Greg because he's got the
14266.62s: determination the guts to make it work
14267.88s: but on the other hand David well I think
14270.40s: he's just open a restaurant because he
14271.96s: wants to make a quick buck and that is
14273.94s: not the reason to open restaurant that
14275.38s: man has no passion tough

14324.46s: uphold the service standards and the
14327.34s: food quality that we have and it will
14329.80s: continue to make money I can do it and
14332.50s: John has run this in to the ground
14336.28s: John has just let things go I've
14338.68s: certainly got a lot of kilter he needs
14340.96s: to stop he's got to be the spark he's
14343.24s: got to be the fire you can't just be
14344.98s: back there
14350.71s: [Music]
14353.02s: thinking and contemplating what he's
14354.94s: supposed to do he's got to do it it's

14362.50s: chef in the kitchen I'm just here to

14369.88s: got an order up get a lot of complaints
14371.98s: about the quality of the food here and
14374.20s: that was just a Frozen family
14376.48s: black birds that was really gross it's
14379.00s: not much fun working in a restaurant
14380.44s: when all you had to experiment with is
14382.72s: canned beans and enchilada sauce out of
14385.78s: a jar the standards have declined so far
14388.30s: that I'm not even sure we can revive it
14390.64s: I don't think we'll come back
14392.20s: unless something
14394.53s: [Music]
14397.12s: just pretty much flatlined

14998.98s: rolled over and died you think there's
15000.90s: two greasy

15025.98s: looks like a dog's dinner what is that
15027.24s: oh my God that is a shock
15031.26s: um I'm absolutely devastated I mean
15033.12s: they're cutting corners but all the
15034.38s: wrong places and John's clueless nobody
15037.20s: responsible for the kitchen but overall
15038.58s: it's an insult of fast food it's a
15041.28s: [ __ ] disgrace
15043.02s: these
15050.16s: are good
15052.76s: garlicky but let's suppose food coming
15055.14s: back
15058.20s: I don't know what to say
15059.94s: we've just put in a process line more
15061.74s: food coming back has been sent out and
15063.78s: it's almost like you guys have just you
15065.28s: know given up
15066.54s: I'm standing here in my jaw on the floor
15068.28s: this was definitely humiliating
15070.02s: eye-opening embarrassing Gordon Ramsay's
15073.08s: appearance at the restaurant may have
15074.64s: brought in some extra customers we're
15076.80s: not eating we're gonna eat something
15078.42s: but unfortunately the food has scared
15081.06s: many of them away Jay Willis is doing
15083.28s: bad because John's killing off the
15085.32s: business that's about mine
15089.70s: after a miserable dinner service Gordon
15092.76s: decides that he needs to meet with not
15094.68s: only the owners but with the entire
15096.96s: staff we have some serious issues back
15099.78s: there I wanted you all together to get
15102.42s: an idea of how you felt and how does it
15106.68s: make you feel when you serve that food
15110.70s: embarrassing
15111.96s: I'm amazed you guys put up with it let's
15114.00s: get
15114.96s: here every day because the paychecks
15116.52s: keep getting Slimmer and Slimmer and our
15119.04s: sales are dropping Like a Rock because
15121.08s: of John's inability to make anything
15123.66s: happen
15126.96s: Rick you're not here you're killing this
15129.12s: man over here saying that he's not good
15131.10s: at anything Sam wouldn't be here if this
15133.92s: restaurant wasn't dying so you don't you
15137.04s: can't blame this on me
15139.58s: there's stuff everywhere I'm staying
15142.26s: don't blame everything on him
15146.48s: I cannot come down here and run this
15149.34s: restaurant we lived three and a half
15151.80s: hours away John has to do it has to come
15154.74s: from John
15167.78s: Naomi to the cross
15170.10s: Rick's ridiculous I really just want a
15172.38s: punch trick sometimes to be honest this
15174.66s: whole issue is not what the problem is
15177.12s: with this restaurant the problem here
15179.94s: whether we all like you or not is the
15182.04s: food sucks
15184.80s: and it's not fresh
15187.20s: and even frozen food is handled badly
15190.14s: all three of you should be ashamed to
15193.50s: stand there and allow it to go on is it
15196.68s: time to get somebody else in to run it I
15198.18s: mean you know
15199.62s: have you had enough
15201.30s: I believe it's still in me I just need
15203.16s: somebody to help I need somebody to
15204.66s: cover my back
15206.10s: all three of you need to wake up and
15208.68s: wake up quickly
15213.00s: after the staff meeting Gordon takes a
15215.52s: peek into the kitchen storage
15217.58s: and uncovers the unthinkable this is
15221.46s: basic hygiene it doesn't get drained in
15224.16s: the blood it's sat on a warm kitchen
15226.14s: it's not even cold John there's more uh
15229.44s: when Chef Gordon pulled those potato
15231.84s: skins out I knew that he had found
15234.42s: something that I wasn't going to like he
15236.40s: said hold on a minute that's going to be
15237.78s: deep fried tomorrow yeah
15240.18s: that's really going to make it taste
15241.68s: better right
15242.88s: it tastes a rotten and we're sat here
15244.80s: wondering why the business is on his ass
15247.32s: starts at the top John it's called
15249.78s: responsibility no wonder you've given up
15252.60s: I've been in denial and I've lowered my
15254.64s: standards and it takes somebody like a
15256.80s: Gordon Ramsay to come in and wake you up
15259.08s: Rotten Tomatoes soft rotten stuff
15263.72s: the rotten Peppers the whole box is
15266.76s: wrong
15267.66s: I wanted to crawl into the table and
15269.94s: hide my face so people wouldn't
15271.32s: associate me with such crap if you're
15273.72s: seriously are honest with yourself that
15275.94s: you are starting again then we start
15277.92s: again well we'll do whatever it takes
15281.16s: I'll be [ __ ] ashamed
15285.10s: [Music]
15287.04s: where do I start with the problems in
15288.24s: this restaurant the staff have got their
15289.68s: issues but that's irrelevant the big
15291.00s: problem is the food and the quicker they
15292.32s: all get up to speed without [ __ ] the
15294.12s: food is the better because that is
15295.98s: embarrassing
15298.62s: John yeah you're gonna pitch all this
15301.14s: crap Chef Ramses gave us a challenge to
15304.38s: see if we're committed to changing this
15306.36s: food and making it better it's a fresh
15308.34s: start for every everybody everything all
15310.62s: right oh my God are they taking all the
15312.66s: food out they are I guess we start new
15316.14s: tomorrow I was absolutely ecstatic that
15318.96s: he was throwing everything away it has
15320.70s: been a huge complaint for a long time
15325.82s: yeah I have to now it could let it go
15330.50s: it's a huge amount of food that we throw
15332.64s: away this evening
15336.72s: we're starting fresh and that means
15338.76s: getting rid of everything
15342.60s: when I finally saw
15344.52s: [Music]
15347.10s: today I knew that we were taking the
15349.50s: first step to making progress okay
15352.32s: there's a fresh start to a fresh day
15357.66s: after the owners took it upon themselves
15359.88s: to clean out their restaurant this
15362.22s: morning Gordon is looking for the owners

15389.90s: okay clearing your consciences about
15393.36s: reaching inside and being honest with
15395.46s: yourself yeah biggest fear is what my
15399.78s: fate rest in John's hands and that
15403.62s: really scares me I want this to work
15405.66s: desperately I just haven't got much to
15408.72s: work with that's what I'm struggling
15410.76s: with most people who face depression and
15413.10s: problems I have give up and I refuse to
15416.16s: do that I'll fight till the last dog
15418.26s: dies I like your determination you know
15420.66s: I appreciate Chef
15425.78s: who'd you turn to I don't have anybody
15429.12s: to
15430.14s: voice my concerns so
15432.30s: it's been tough everything's pretty much
15434.52s: inside that's not easy
15437.40s: truthfully I'm just
15439.68s: struggling to find
15441.42s: an internal flight have you got it
15444.12s: because I don't feel it with support
15449.16s: I've got it inside me it's there what I
15452.64s: saw last night was huge

15474.36s: John's body
15476.10s: I think things would be a little bit
15478.44s: better he'd have more enthusiasm a
15480.90s: little bit more passion
15482.94s: he's just lacking in that

15713.90s: with no one taking control of the
15716.34s: situation I don't know what to do the
15718.68s: kitchen and the restaurant for that
15720.24s: matter is in a state of confusion Dave

15734.34s: I was just gonna keep trying to put the
15736.50s: food out going back to regular fries so
15739.50s: we started making the burgers on
15740.88s: sourdough bread and using the frozen
15742.74s: french fries in the frozen ground beef
15744.92s: dude this I can't serve this
15753.74s: in an effort to make good on the orders
15757.92s: A desperate kitchen staff lowers its
15760.32s: standards and starts delivering cheap
15762.24s: substitutes sorry about that hit your
15765.60s: bun that is all we have is a bun and the
15768.78s: disappointment combined with the long
15770.52s: wait is too much for One customer to
15772.92s: Bear
15777.44s: would you like something else
15786.80s: [Music]

15806.46s: John
15807.50s: 1860 when I said take it off
15810.36s: we were dropping the standards just a
15812.88s: bit but we were under tremendous
15814.80s: pressure because there were so many
15816.12s: people out there that were anxious to
15817.74s: try the food if you haven't got the
15819.00s: right buns we shouldn't be serving it
15820.26s: and what's the point in lowering the
15821.58s: standard just to keep it on it doesn't
15823.44s: make [ __ ] sense
15825.14s: boys that's gotta go bad he's afraid of
15828.66s: pink sorry now I got two paper plates
15830.70s: around some sort of big meatballs how do

15835.10s: what do they say it's disgusting
15838.08s: unedible unbelievable such a shame
15840.42s: because we got off to a really good
15841.38s: start but then kind of started dropping
15843.36s: but John and Rick accepted the standards
15845.64s: dropping and they just were happy to
15847.08s: send slots so the real sad end into the
15849.78s: evening because right now we're back to
15851.58s: square one
15852.83s: [Music]
15857.10s: should be ashamed

16661.88s: come to the heart of America and meet a
16663.44s: really nice bunch of hard work and
16664.58s: humble individuals but when I first
16666.32s: arrived I honestly thought the Russian
16667.64s: was beyond salvation but tonight's
16669.26s: showed a little glimmer of hope so long
16671.48s: may continue and haven't helped them
16676.64s: in the days that followed everyone at J
16679.40s: Willies worked hard to keep their
16681.20s: standards up do it start hauling out
16683.18s: thank you gentlemen and continue to
16685.28s: perfect their barbecue sauce a sauce
16687.98s: that earned Jay Willy's first prize at

16692.36s: cook-off
16696.22s: with a taste of success the staff at J
16699.68s: Willies continues to work together to
16702.20s: make its new barbecue house a success
16707.56s: it may only be an hour outside of
16710.12s: Manhattan
16712.34s: but the quiet town of Cranberry New
16714.50s: Jersey feels like it's thousands of
16716.42s: miles away in this historic village is a
16719.84s: little French Bistro called Hannah and
16721.76s: Masons friends Chris and Brian were
16724.58s: co-workers here under the previous
16726.02s: owners and jumped at the opportunity to
16728.54s: buy the restaurant three years ago can
16731.00s: we get serious now please all right come
16732.38s: on focus focus I was afraid from the
16734.36s: beginning to take the restaurant oh what
16736.22s: the [ __ ] am I doing this I was also a
16738.92s: little short of cash so I figured Brian
16740.72s: knew the operation we worked together
16743.42s: already and he had the other half of the
16745.88s: cash we could do this we could do this
16748.52s: but looking back no I don't think I
16750.44s: would go into business with Brian this
16752.42s: was a mistake
16754.36s: I'm very laid back and I I don't think I
16758.06s: let a lot of things bother me Ryan you
16760.46s: suck whatever
16762.04s: Brian's very lazy Brian can be lazy
16765.32s: Brian needs to step up a lot I just find
16767.66s: it difficult to be motivated that's just
16770.48s: how I've always been and I find it
16772.52s: difficult to change
16773.61s: [Music]
16774.80s: when your heart's not in it why that's
16776.84s: what anybody else is doing it why I
16778.22s: agree my partnership with Brian is
16782.90s: not equal enough enough for this [ __ ]
16785.84s: please I generally pay most of the bills
16788.72s: but I spent a good portion of the day
16790.22s: ordering food doing prep lists working
16792.56s: on menus generally I'll work the line
16794.60s: for most dinners
16797.36s: Brian why are you clean
16799.54s: I don't particularly like to work the
16801.74s: nights so we're only open three nights a
16804.44s: week for dinner done there's no more to
16806.54s: be had I really don't think we're losing
16808.52s: out on any business
16809.51s: [Music]

16820.16s: can't bring in the money
16823.24s: we're having a very tough time making
16825.44s: ends meet it has been increasingly more
16827.84s: and more stressful to come in and look
16829.70s: at how much we owe money to and the
16831.44s: bills are piling up and it's it's a
16833.42s: little too much stress for me all right
16834.92s: this pretty much sucks hopefully we make
16836.48s: some money tonight I go to try to
16838.82s: deposit my paycheck in the bank and I
16841.58s: can't because there's no money
16845.60s: sick of how many we spend on bounce
16847.58s: check fees it's it's a horrible feeling
16850.22s: oh my gosh if Hannah me since ever had
16854.06s: to close I would be lost because I
16856.70s: wouldn't be able to support my daughter
16859.34s: you know for me it's a career I don't
16861.08s: know anything else I don't want to
16861.98s: really know anything else

18682.26s: it's been an interesting launch
18684.38s: Gordon knows that in order for Hannah
18686.58s: and Masons to make a profit they must
18688.92s: successfully flip tables and have two
18691.38s: complete seatings
18693.32s: Chris yeah Chef we have to fit tables

19536.72s: I didn't want anybody to get the

19556.34s: real crab it's artificial crab so we
19559.16s: spelled it with a K so there was no
19560.54s: misconception so it's fake crab meat in
19563.84s: a seafood restaurant on the water
19565.12s: [Music]
19574.30s: holy crap rubber tasteless that's going
19578.12s: straight to the trash
19579.62s: oh my God what's wrong why the fake crab
19585.20s: was the number one reason
19587.42s: okay omelette didn't go over well he
19589.76s: doesn't like the crab in there I I've
19591.62s: never that was already here I didn't buy
19593.54s: that stuff I don't want to use frozen
19595.16s: fish it's not product that I'm
19596.78s: absolutely overly proud of but at the
19598.76s: same point I'm held accountable for all
19600.26s: the inventory that the owners have paid
19601.76s: for how's the food so far why are we
19604.52s: serving fake crab in a long way I don't
19606.26s: he did that you're the general manager
19610.52s: why'd you laugh I give the choice have
19612.86s: you been drinking no the crab was
19615.32s: shocking embarrassing and fake it tastes
19617.84s: disgusting have you tasted that crap no
19620.30s: I'm extremely allergic
19627.82s: oh my gosh
19629.96s: I'll let you finish
19633.08s: general manager my ass I'm being lame a
19636.50s: few things that I should allowed him to
19637.94s: do that for letting him serve those
19639.98s: types of rashes so let's play cram AJ is
19642.92s: the general manager he's supposed to
19644.24s: oversee the food and now I'm hoping and
19647.06s: praying that Gordon says AJ is the one
19649.10s: that's playing this business
19651.14s: fish and chips certainly the best
19653.30s: looking thing I've seen
19656.02s: somebody rubbery is it frozen the fish I
19659.12s: believe it's frozen it is frozen when
19661.34s: you take a bite of that card it's almost
19663.44s: like you've got a breaded condom in your
19665.60s: mouth
19668.14s: he said it was rubbery uh too greasy and
19671.72s: it just said it tasted like a frozen Cod
19673.46s: and obviously he hit it right on the
19674.78s: bottom so this is the same recipe that
19676.76s: we've used here forever so I am for
19679.46s: change I want the change good
19682.34s: wow this one is the Samurai look for

19706.30s: there's one man's opinion it's a pretty
19708.98s: successful opinion though [ __ ]

19743.78s: the top sellers that's why the place has
19746.12s: got such a [ __ ] reputation for crap food
19749.12s: still not clear who's in charge of the
19751.70s: food he's in charge of the food

19784.28s: excuses and never wants to own up to his
19787.28s: faults it's terrible AJ it's got to be
19790.58s: your responsibility no no
19796.40s: with no one taking responsibility for
19799.22s: any of the problems Gordon knows the
19801.38s: best way to get any answers is to

23948.10s: he was an arrogant jerk Insidious and

23952.12s: about it he really does care and he made
23953.98s: me realize I have a purpose and he got
23955.84s: something out of me that I haven't had
23957.22s: come out in a long time and that's

23986.08s: west of the Hudson River
23988.18s: West Nyack is home to Vic and Yolanda
23990.58s: Flores who previously owned another
23992.50s: Mexican restaurant that failed they
23995.20s: wanted to try again but didn't have the
23997.24s: money so they asked Yolanda's daughter
23999.28s: Patty to use her credit and savings 100
24003.08s: owner on paper but my stepfather Vic
24006.78s: controls everything all right she
24010.02s: listened to me he didn't listen to my
24011.94s: daughter he does whatever he wants to do
24014.16s: we have to discuss the problems
24018.80s: I thought this was a big opportunity but
24022.02s: from day one it turned out to be a
24025.14s: disaster
24028.38s: initially we were busy and then after a
24031.50s: while it just the number started
24032.82s: dwindling is it normally this quiet so I
24035.88s: said maybe we should make some changes
24037.20s: and he said everything's fine I've been
24039.72s: thinking of changing the menu but my
24042.24s: husband say people like it
24046.70s: or how many people we spent so much time
24050.34s: just looking out the windows staring at
24052.38s: each other because how many tables are
24054.24s: there nothing now figuring what can we
24056.94s: do to bring people in it's like the

24065.70s: it looks like Tijuana threw up in here
24068.22s: he has a stuffed Chili Pepper that he
24070.14s: moves around named Manuel it makes fun

24083.94s: she has problem in her marriage I I just

24090.06s: this position I never
24092.70s: thought it was going to be this but I
24096.48s: realized it was bad we can't pair our

24401.70s: ways we should have stepped in a long
24403.38s: time ago now it just seems like this is
24405.54s: the end of our world hopefully we can
24407.34s: make some type of changes to save this

24453.42s: here I put my credit my home I borrowed
24457.02s: money from my father-in-law it's not
24459.00s: important to him it's not important to
24460.32s: him to make things right with me what
24462.36s: does it take to break even how much do
24464.16s: we need to take a week to break even
24465.54s: ninety thousand a month a month yeah a
24468.90s: month so 22 Grand a week we do a third
24471.84s: of that so

24507.18s: can the women complain about that if
24508.62s: they haven't put the time and effort in
24510.78s: this place so personally they're all too
24513.12s: [ __ ] blame

24986.58s: I think they got a dose of reality he
24989.10s: walked around like he was untouchable
24991.20s: so I was relieved that finally somebody
24993.18s: else
24994.14s: told him that he was responsible for a
24996.30s: lot of this
24997.68s: while Vic supervises the cleanup
24999.99s: [Music]
25002.20s: Chef Ramsay spends his time with a woman
25005.00s: who was torn between her daughter and
25007.16s: her husband what I'm really concerned
25009.74s: about is what's happening to your
25011.54s: daughter
25012.52s: how did it start because something's
25015.44s: blurring for me my career was messed up
25018.26s: so we use potty for credit
25023.02s: yeah you've destroyed your daughter's
25027.26s: credit because now she has no choice I
25029.24s: mean you and her are in the [ __ ] my
25031.46s: darling
25032.54s: I know sometimes I can sleep at night
25035.42s: do you love Rick
25037.52s: I know but it's different now you know
25040.88s: now before you came here I said this
25043.70s: doesn't work I don't think you and I
25045.08s: could be
25046.16s: together anymore
25049.10s: also for your husband
25050.72s: my daughter
25053.48s: at this point you know I realize that
25055.34s: it's not not really a choice
25057.50s: right now the only way to show Patty to
25059.36s: how much you care is to get involved yes
25061.84s: business around
25064.10s: I always tell me what to do
25068.12s: another marriage that is affected by
25070.04s: Fiesta sunrise's debt is Patty and Dons
25073.52s: usually Don drops her off to avoid
25075.74s: running into Vic but on this occasion
25077.84s: Patty asked him to come in and meet Chef
25079.94s: Ramsay good to see you I want to save
25082.58s: the relationship with my husband because
25084.50s: he's really angry at me for getting
25086.72s: involved and it just seems to be
25088.28s: spiraling out of control
25089.73s: [Music]
25091.94s: um obviously Paddy explained I'm
25094.64s: absolutely Furious in terms of the way
25096.92s: the kitchen was run the way the place
25098.36s: has been abused and I can't believe a
25100.52s: guy like Vic would try to do so much
25104.08s: under your own eyes without even you
25107.30s: knowing anything about it are you aware
25109.52s: of what's been going on we fight all the
25111.20s: time about it yeah he saw it coming and
25113.42s: I said no he wouldn't do this he
25115.22s: wouldn't do that and he said he's he's
25117.74s: not who he appears to be he's taking
25120.26s: advantage of you and your mom yeah your
25122.96s: mom admitted last night that you had a
25124.64s: clean credit record oh my goodness
25127.48s: I got abused that's one thing I'm mad at
25130.64s: him you know money can always be made
25133.22s: and we paid back yeah the credit he just
25136.16s: never paid the the monthly payment on do
25139.34s: you think you can get more involved in
25140.60s: terms of support mechanism oh sure when
25143.18s: I saw Dan my reaction was like well this
25147.20s: is Patricia's husband this is nothing to
25150.14s: do in the business I have
25153.38s: sit down
25156.32s: I'm trying to get to the bottom of it
25157.70s: Vic I'm trying to understand the madness
25160.52s: into how we've been operating when you
25162.62s: knew you're borrowing all that money
25163.76s: from family why won't you be more honest
25166.10s: about where the money was going
25169.34s: you know that's not clear
25172.58s: now it is
25174.14s: but when I asked him are you going to
25175.52s: give Patty any money no no I don't think
25177.80s: so that really doesn't cut it I believe
25180.44s: Don's trying to stand up for me he feels
25182.66s: that big walks all over me you're not
25184.16s: going to give my wife any money

29238.60s: when you see a chef putting those
29239.86s: ingredients together it's it's rather

29243.88s: him and he hasn't got a [ __ ] clue
29246.48s: okay Chef the next course your salmon
29250.30s: Creeks they come out like that normally

29302.44s: you get it

29340.12s: me this has been going on for a while
29341.92s: Pinto tries to stretch the food as far
29344.20s: as it can go and sometimes too far bring

29703.18s: nightmare of Cafe 36 is still food time
29706.00s: not being able to get your food out of
29707.68s: the kitchen really makes your job as a
29709.06s: server difficult because it's pretty
29710.98s: much the description of your job to
29713.38s: serve
29714.82s: D first this sucks everything seems so
29718.18s: slow yeah so if you have one more person
29720.58s: then it goes faster yeah if you had one
29722.68s: more person it'll go faster yeah sure

29748.30s: mortuary on trolleys no right not
29750.40s: serving food
29754.18s: would you like to hold the place by the
29756.16s: hand or would you want to push a trolley

29759.40s: my hand when the orders finally make it
29761.86s: to the tables customers find it's not
29764.44s: worth the wait

29798.82s: seasoned asparagus no not right now

29827.96s: [Music]
29830.50s: tonight I'm starting to see new cooking
29832.24s: techniques that I've never ever seen
29833.44s: before slow for fresh frozen but what's
29836.68s: becoming really clear that he seriously
29838.36s: is taking this lovely couple for a ride
29840.22s: and it's got a stop
29844.06s: this is true about Pinto he's telling
29847.36s: you he's screwing you does that could
29849.94s: that be
29851.08s: I hope not
29852.09s: [Music]
29854.38s: we don't know what our ass from a home
29856.18s: or not
29858.85s: [Applause]
29859.70s: [Music]
29866.08s: during dinner service owners Carol and
29869.02s: Terry were stunned by Gordon's criticism
29871.24s: of their head chef Pinto we don't know
29874.36s: our ass
29878.33s: [Music]
29879.52s: he opened our eyes to a lot of things
29881.44s: throughout the restaurant that
29883.66s: people have been taking advantage of us
29886.06s: so we have to take a good hard look at
29889.54s: everything
29890.82s: after a long difficult dinner service
29893.56s: the customers who have eaten are not
29896.14s: exactly thrilled chicken's a little
29898.12s: overdone
29899.56s: okay so two soupy and the chicken is
29901.18s: overdone I didn't eat much much really
29904.12s: care for the dressing and those who
29906.34s: haven't been served are not willing to
29908.68s: wait we got here five or seven
29915.58s: all right table five is gonna walk out
29917.38s: in five minutes but is this the place we
29919.48s: move about is this the fastest we go
29920.80s: Nintendo has one speed and that speed is
29923.44s: [ __ ] you
29925.18s: how long has it been almost two and a
29927.94s: half hours some of the customers have
29929.86s: given up completely on Cafe 36 and are
29932.68s: leaving without even eating an appetizer
29934.90s: it's just been a long day I have to
29937.24s: really take it all in it hurts
29942.54s: after a rough night Gordon confronts the
29946.06s: staff overall honestly pretty
29948.82s: disappointing
29950.44s: both in the kitchen and the dining room
29952.12s: there's one thing in here that I would
29954.22s: change instantly
29957.40s: on the back of my experience today
29960.58s: and that's you
29962.38s: why
29963.58s: you are the executive chef you're
29966.40s: supposed to be a leader a motivator you
29969.22s: are seriously seriously leading this
29971.20s: place into bankruptcy because the big
29975.04s: problem in this restaurant Pinto is in
29977.38s: the kitchen fresh frozen slow four I
29981.88s: think that Pinto deserved every single
29985.24s: solitary second of that ass rieman he
29988.60s: got from Gordon if this was your
29990.94s: restaurant would you be freezing
29992.80s: everything pushing it and then dropping
29995.14s: in bowls of water to defrost it to
29997.06s: re-cook it yes or no
30001.16s: no I wouldn't
30004.02s: Percy

30163.50s: your weaknesses and improve your
30165.96s: strengths right and you know Pinto is a
30168.90s: big weakness and don't ever be
30170.64s: intimidated by controlling chefs and
30173.10s: you've got to be strong you must be
30174.60s: strong absolutely and I can see that now

30463.98s: evening we weren't working together as a
30466.92s: team and it hurt us it should be up in

30534.66s: very upset to the point that I almost
30536.52s: fired him on the spot but this has gone
30538.68s: on way too far he's nuts you don't like
30540.24s: working here
30541.68s: and keep your opinions to yourself I
30543.96s: want Terry to start telling everybody

30547.32s: inmates run the Asylum you're a waiter
30549.54s: remember who you work for
30554.52s: After experiencing yet another
30556.68s: disappointing dinner service Gordon is
30559.20s: curious to hear what the head chef has
30561.12s: to say Okay
30562.98s: um
30564.06s: Pinto what do you think about tonight's
30565.80s: service
30566.58s: it was it was excellent it really was
30568.56s: everybody got involved
30570.90s: what kitchen were you in

30581.60s: complete different opinions you're right
30584.58s: though service was terrible nothing was
30586.80s: coming together no communication no

30596.76s: happen to us
30598.56s: what do we do let me just give you three
30601.74s: major issues that's wrong with this
30604.32s: restaurant the first issue is the
30606.90s: service is way too slow the second
30609.48s: problem the food is too inconsistent
30612.56s: inconsistency is a killer
30615.30s: the third reason and one of the most
30616.86s: important reasons why this restaurant is
30618.54s: not busy it's not contemporary a 1970s
30622.02s: restaurant trying to compete in the 2008
30625.56s: Market were behind the times we are
30628.02s: behind the times okay I'm going now I'm

30634.50s: well put together plan good night
30638.88s: that night Gordon and his team went to
30641.40s: work doing away with the restaurant's
30643.50s: old-fashioned and outdated look creating
