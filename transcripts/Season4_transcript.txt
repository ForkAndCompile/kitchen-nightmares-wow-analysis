5974.84s: what I mean yeah it's fragmented to
5976.88s: where there's nothing constructive
5978.88s: taking place but in Mitch I think
5982.00s: there's a Broken Man there he's
5984.40s: spent he works his ass off and what do
5987.36s: he get what's his
5989.88s: payoff 16 years in that business

8544.92s: owner Frank has had
8546.48s: [Music]
8553.44s: enough might not go back in tonight I
8556.52s: definitely lost the passion for cooking
8558.36s: or for being in the restaurant business
8560.48s: period I don't know what to do
8562.88s: anymore with Frank abandoning the
8565.32s: kitchen suf Eddie and the rest of the
8567.72s: staff finish off a painful dinner
8570.04s: service
8570.96s: chck long sorry about that folks thank
8574.44s: you very much have a good
8575.68s: [Music]
8581.56s: night tonight I saw something quite
8584.68s: frightening wasn't the bad food wasn't
8587.28s: the complaints and it certainly wasn't
8589.52s: the
8590.52s: service it was
8593.04s: Frank and here's why watching him he is
8597.24s: so burnt out he's given up it's like a
8601.88s: ticking Time Bomb that's about to
8606.36s: explode I
8608.76s: [Music]
8609.92s: know I love him and I've seen how much
8613.32s: over the years he's done for
8616.68s: everyone and all and he feels so
8619.52s: defeated I can see it and
8622.28s: he come come on come on come come hey
8625.28s: hey hey hey hey I don't want to see like
8626.72s: this
8627.68s: hey that's why I can see it that's why
8630.56s: we called because we want to help this
8632.76s: is not about a guy that can't be
8634.80s: bothered to cook he is done he's on the
8637.88s: floor I know and he's barely
8641.36s: breathing what do we do we start by
8644.56s: bringing him back tonight take 10
8647.96s: minutes out and think of something
8649.76s: you've never said to him before that can
8652.08s: help to inspire him you understand yes
8656.12s: good night good night thank you very
8658.36s: much Frank it's stb but he's got a good
8661.40s: heart I think he thinks I'm against them
8663.76s: it's really not like that you know it's
8666.20s: it's my
8667.12s: brother I love
8670.20s: them but if we can't work together
8673.12s: without a doubt we will close the
8675.30s: [Music]
8682.56s: doors Frank has clearly lost his passion
8686.64s: and unfortunately his family and his
8689.32s: business are being dragged down with him
8691.64s: let's uh sit down Chef Ramsey knows that
8694.52s: if this restaurant has any chance of
8696.44s: surviving he must find a way to inspire
8699.24s: Frank take a
8701.04s: seat when I watched you last night from
8703.68s: start to finish it upset me and here's
8706.28s: why I witnessed a broken
8708.96s: man I could see all stress has killed
8712.44s: your spirit I spoke to them Kim and
8715.20s: Anthony late last night and they both
8718.12s: just want to say something to you
8719.84s: personally
8721.12s: Anthony wrote it down go a [ __ ]
8724.96s: speech Frank we both know we're not good
8727.36s: at this stuff
8729.36s: so all
8731.64s: right Frank I think you have been so
8734.12s: overwhelmed for so long for good reason
8737.32s: I know how much damage I've
8739.38s: [Music]
8746.04s: done you can all take deep breath come
8748.88s: on it's all right
8753.40s: and and you had to hold it together now
8756.88s: I believe you need to take care of
8758.44s: yourself you and I both know that you
8760.76s: have it in you to get back into life no
8763.36s: matter what we say to each other you
8764.84s: know if it comes out to it I'm always
8766.64s: there I think we lost sight of what we
8769.08s: really counts I believe we can really
8770.92s: make this place work you know that we
8773.12s: can if we put the effort into it we
8775.68s: don't ever say it but I do love you
8778.16s: that's it
8782.00s: my brother's never that's the first time
8784.32s: I heard any remorse from him legitimate
8787.52s: remorse should I listen or should I not
8790.92s: listen I don't know Kim to say I love
8795.88s: you is an understatement and to say that
8799.92s: I'm always beside you I think you know
8802.80s: that the past 12 years have been the
8805.12s: hardest of our lives but we made it
8807.24s: through
8808.20s: together because we love each other
8810.88s: and I look at the way you talk to people
8813.36s: lately and the mean things that come out
8816.08s: of your mouth and I think it comes from
8819.00s: you holding this burden for the whole
8821.20s: family for so long on your
8825.64s: shoulders you haven't put this Chef Jack
8828.60s: on in 4 years cuz I think inside you
8832.28s: felt you didn't deserve it anymore but
8835.08s: you do you're actually one of the most
8837.24s: talented people I've ever met in my life
8840.24s: that lack of passion that showed in the
8842.20s: food yesterday for Gordon was a cry for
8845.00s: help you are worth it and you deserve
8847.72s: success and you've worked hard for it
8850.48s: and you deserve it Frank but the only
8853.00s: way this place is going to make it is
8855.72s: you have to look within you and break
8858.24s: down this wall that you've
8861.96s: built please put this back
8865.60s: on no I'm serious
8870.24s: I don't deserve to wear that jacket
8871.84s: because Asma could put out the food I
8873.80s: was putting out you don't wear a uniform
8875.80s: if you don't produce put it back on not
8888.72s: yet after an emotional we don't ever say
8891.48s: it but I do love you and hopeful plea
8893.80s: from his family please put this back on
8896.48s: not yet Chef Ramsey goes to work I don't
8899.64s: care about the [ __ ] that's been kicked
8901.48s: into you years ago you got to cook
8903.36s: trying to reignite Frank's passion in
8905.48s: the kitchen I want you to think of
8906.76s: something that you want to cook and put
8908.28s: the passion on the plate not the anger
8910.40s: Ramy didn't like a freaking thing I made
8912.20s: yesterday I don't know what to do to
8914.00s: flee the guy what are you thinking of
8915.76s: doing my God it's total blank I hope he
8918.68s: thinks it's good P this in a simple
8921.08s: lemon cap white
8922.44s: wine nice I like to see your mind
8925.00s: working you know that means your
8926.68s: passion's coming back Frankie has a
8929.08s: talent to put out that the food if he
8931.44s: gets dedicated it could be done if it's
8933.84s: over before you got in the sauce
8935.52s: shallots time a little dash of
8938.72s: rosemary no
8940.96s: good it's delicious you're always on the

8949.76s: I'd be like a piging
8951.28s: [ __ ] he liked it cooking with Chef

8955.64s: at the old days the way I had passion
8957.60s: about doing things absolutely delicious

9724.20s: brother Providence Rhode Island home to
9727.00s: seven colleges and a thriving art scene
9729.96s: this Renaissance city is a constant
9731.92s: beehive of activity in 2005 Abby and her
9736.00s: best friend Rico bought a restaurant
9737.96s: called down City smack in the center of
9740.96s: town Rico and I were on the beach one
9743.68s: day and I told him that I was interested
9747.00s: in buying down City and he said I want
9750.04s: to own a restaurant
9752.48s: too I was spending a lot of money in
9754.88s: restaurants eating and drinking and I
9756.72s: figured why not give myself the money
9759.64s: instead make it a double he has a
9762.32s: full-time day job and my job is to take
9765.68s: care of everything in this restaurant
9767.52s: you start with all the specials I'm
9768.80s: going to get the wine okay I've been in
9770.48s: the restaurant business for 33 years so
9772.76s: the decisions I make I really don't
9774.44s: consult Recon about them I just do them
9776.52s: and this would go perfectly with the
9778.16s: pork special I am the checkbook behind
9780.04s: down City and I was putting 100% of my
9782.76s: faith in Abby but at this point it's not
9785.80s: going well I need more asses in the
9788.84s: seats I think it's a beautiful
9790.84s: restaurant I think our menu is creative
9793.48s: and the food is good I don't know what's
9795.84s: wrong it's all [ __ ] up Abby has her
9798.84s: blind F on because she doesn't want to
9801.40s: admit that she's part of the problem
9803.72s: just give him no let me do it Abby acts
9806.28s: like whatever don't argue Kella DeVille
9809.88s: I just want an answer when I call
9811.04s: something out Abby is a complete psycho
9814.16s: [ __ ] [ __ ] I just want an answer
9816.60s: which is a recipe for utter disaster I
9819.68s: had fixed it yesterday I checked it
9821.00s: before I left this like really [ __ ]
9822.88s: happening I'm not yelling I'm talking
9825.04s: they think that this is a democracy and
9826.40s: it's not if you cannot follow my rules
9828.32s: then get the [ __ ] out as long as you
9829.60s: work for me you do what my way and upset
9831.96s: it's basically aby's way of the highway
9834.12s: and it's definitely why your
9835.36s: restaurant's failing Welcome To My
9837.96s: Nightmare there's no consistency just
9841.28s: like mus if people are complaining about
9843.04s: the food maybe there's something wrong
9844.08s: with the food it is impossible for the
9845.60s: friese to be iced cold maybe just Abby
9847.48s: saying it's great does not make it great
9849.64s: that's how the plate is prepared do you
9851.44s: not like it no she built this 50 item
9854.04s: menu that is just horrible they hate the
9856.48s: chicken pie ards what nobody can say
9858.60s: anything about menu because it's her
9859.96s: menu she takes it personally maybe
9862.12s: they're not the right decisions but
9864.64s: they're my
9865.76s: decisions I have to get Abby on board to
9869.60s: move forward because my life is at stake
9873.20s: here all I think about is why people are
9875.92s: not coming to my restaurant if something
9878.44s: happened here where I had to declare
9880.48s: bankruptcy it could very strongly affect
9884.24s: my day job that's stress we've got all

10329.68s: closest what does that mean talk to me
10331.92s: Abby that means that I fired my other
10334.76s: chef and he took over and I didn't want
10336.84s: to give him a title until he proved to
10339.24s: himself that he could handle the
10341.64s: kitchen Abby what you're employing is a
10345.04s: ship with no Captain at the helm and the
10347.28s: team desperate for
10349.16s: guidance no guidance is no standards no
10352.20s: standards is no consistency so who came

11055.84s: Ramsey wants to give the staff something
11057.52s: they have been rarely given a chance to
11059.88s: talk freely without getting fired so
11062.84s: this is what we're going to do and I
11064.64s: want each of you to write down some
11068.44s: questions and direct them to the person
11071.68s: you want them to
11074.88s: answer this is going to be another hell
11077.32s: day for me don't sign your name it's
11079.60s: Anonymous I knew that if we were going
11081.52s: to do an exercise um and talking about
11084.00s: the restaurant I knew that it was all
11085.92s: going to be directed at me all thank you
11087.84s: very much okay good here's the uh the
11091.72s: first one wow Abby wine is the menu so
11096.84s: huge we uh just um to give the customer
11100.32s: more choices but the amount of dishes is
11103.84s: absurd and the more dishes the lower the
11108.20s: standard uh Abby and Jimmy the quality
11110.88s: of the food needs to improve how can we
11113.00s: fix it good question it and it all comes
11116.08s: down to menu size with as many items
11118.16s: that there are if you prep 50 items just
11122.56s: for dinner alone and then the dessert
11124.56s: menu if you can't prep enough stuff it's
11127.84s: like you you just can't do it who's
11129.88s: putting all those dishes on there AB
11133.20s: Abby when I put this menu together I
11136.08s: just expected my staff to just do this
11140.00s: menu Abby why do you not allow anyone to
11144.04s: express their opinions without it being
11146.28s: seen as a personal attack to
11149.92s: you since I bought this restaurant I
11152.36s: became a
11154.84s: defensive [ __ ] I question and I get
11157.92s: upset of the fact that you're
11159.32s: questioning what I'm doing that's
11161.88s: paranoia we do care about this
11164.16s: restaurant you are our friends so we
11167.32s: want to see you succeed and the answer
11169.32s: I've gotten from you in the past is [ __ ]
11171.68s: you that's not true we're just here for
11173.48s: money or we're just here because we're
11175.64s: just here cuz we can't get other jobs
11177.04s: and stuff and it's hurtful because when
11178.80s: you invest so much time and you we would
11181.00s: do anything for you and I completely
11183.04s: realized we' just got to talk more
11184.56s: instead of me yelling and screaming
11186.04s: can't just be my show it's not the Abby
11188.28s: show it's the down City show are you
11190.40s: ready to embrace change yeah absolutely
11193.80s: change absolutely I think this
11195.64s: experience is making Abby realize that
11197.76s: she has to relinquish control and I
11201.16s: think she's going to do it because I
11202.80s: think Abby turning around is definitely
11204.84s: Paramount for this restaurant to survive
11209.00s: right Jimmy let's as aby's menu was

14459.04s: Keith you've been given a second
14461.44s: chance this restaurant needs you not
14464.52s: just the dining room but the kitchen yes
14467.28s: absolutely Keith loud and clear Chef
14469.72s: loud and
14471.24s: clear I think that Gordon's motivation
14474.32s: brought some positive energy back to a
14476.44s: place that was really really lacking
14479.36s: anything positive Lisa I can't do

14501.84s: stop okay thank you for helping my
14505.24s: family y keep it going we have such a
14507.80s: foundation to work from but with our
14509.80s: family problems with the restaurant
14511.56s: issues allinone it needs to start from
14514.12s: the bottom up and I think we need to
14515.56s: start from a clean slate to uh you know
14518.00s: be
14518.91s: [Music]
14521.68s: successful unbelievable I'm actually
14523.88s: shocked that this has ended on a
14525.08s: positive note and who would have thought
14526.72s: that our family been ripped
14528.52s: apart has been saved by Family Style
14531.20s: Dining that's exactly what happened here
14534.24s: at
14535.48s: talini finally a taste of
14539.32s: Isle
14544.64s: GR in the weeks that followed yo if you
14547.24s: find it a little funny that they're
14548.36s: outside arguing right now Keith and Lisa
14550.76s: struggled with their new roles As
14552.20s: Leaders it's too much for me and didn't
14555.20s: commit to the restaurant the way Chef
14557.08s: Ramsey had hoped I need to have a buff
14559.12s: of my cagar in addition a rocky marriage
14562.60s: that was moving in the right direction
14563.84s: direction is now over what is going on
14566.52s: here do me a favor I i' advise you to
14569.00s: zip it
14569.88s: up Keith and Lisa have separated jerk
14573.72s: and the future of talini is uncertain
14576.96s: the doors are now closed and one wonders
14579.68s: if they will ever open
14584.68s: again Pasadena
14587.12s: California home to the Kingston Cafe an
14590.24s: authentic Jamaican restaurant owned by
14592.40s: Dr Yuna Morris who not only is a
14594.80s: practicing radiologist but is a
14596.84s: three-time Olympian all my life I was
14599.40s: able to accomplish the things I really
14600.96s: wanted to do and so I've started the
14603.32s: restaurant because I really enjoy
14604.88s: cooking and there were no other Jamaican
14606.84s: restaurant around when the grill Jam
14608.80s: steak medium rare you know my son is a
14611.44s: manager but we don't necessarily see
14614.16s: things eye to eye k please be quiet I'm
14617.92s: talking she doesn't really listen to my
14619.72s: suggestions and I've gotten to a point
14622.28s: where I can't deal with this everything
14624.40s: has to be cooked to order that's you
14627.08s: can't you can't cook everything order
14628.68s: impossible not here she micromanages
14631.20s: she's focusing on small details like
14633.84s: tablecloths being an inch off it's not
14636.20s: even see one side over there is long and
14638.52s: the other but the biggest focus should
14640.76s: be why don't we have any more customers
14644.08s: I still see DSes all of these have to
14646.84s: change see you have to set standard if
14648.92s: you don't set standard how you expect
14651.04s: something to run well these knife and
14652.88s: fxs are unaccept acceptable I don't like
14654.76s: how some of these look you see sorry Dr
14657.28s: Morris like everyone gets a bit nervous
14659.24s: when she's around even
14661.52s: myself dad they need their food now
14664.76s: there are poor people out there haven't
14666.08s: even gotten their second yet lots of
14668.48s: cooks come in and out they're there for
14670.28s: one day then you never see them again
14671.84s: remember the salt is one of the most
14673.44s: important things not everybody can cook
14675.80s: Jamaican food we can't sell this I don't
14677.88s: like how it tastes at all it's kind of
14679.56s: hard for someone to expect you to do a
14681.92s: job and then they keep stepping in and
14684.08s: not allowing you to do it Mom Mom you
14686.28s: got to you got to let them work that's
14687.48s: not going to happen when she's in the
14688.84s: kitchen it slows things down this cannot
14691.04s: be like this the planting is hanging
14692.96s: over the edges it creates a conflict
14696.00s: when getting plates out and then we have
14697.80s: to deal with the customers who are not
14699.80s: happy sorry about the weight it's cold
14703.32s: the restaurant's drowning and we're all
14705.36s: going down with it if we don't get no
14707.16s: customers be lucky if you get five
14709.04s: tables in all day oh I know it's bad
14711.20s: isn't it if it doesn't change so it's
14714.52s: it's going to
14715.92s: die I cannot sleep because I have so
14718.92s: much debt and my money from my
14721.84s: retirement has almost dried up K
14725.52s: convinced me that g Ramsey would help
14728.04s: the restaurant something has to be done
14731.44s: Chef ramse is my last
14733.52s: [Music]
14737.44s: resort after a phone call early this
14739.96s: morning Chef Ramsey decides to make a
14742.24s: detour before heading to the resta
14743.64s: restaurant oh sir I'm all right good to
14746.24s: see you Dr Morris's son keone has
14748.64s: requested a meeting and Chef Ramsey has
14751.16s: obliged how's it going um difficult
14754.04s: times ready for sure probably doing
14756.24s: about 30% of what we were doing over the
14758.08s: summer wow what's the number one problem
14761.56s: Con in the resturant what is it I would
14763.08s: say my mother's management ready well
14765.84s: she's very much a micromanager and likeu
14767.72s: with the iron fist if I Implement
14769.52s: something she would get angry and she
14771.52s: would want to implement her version of
14773.20s: way of doing oh dear that's mixed
14774.76s: messages are more importantly how
14775.88s: confusing for not just the customers but
14777.52s: for the team exactly like you have to
14779.44s: realize like she came from Jamaica
14781.60s: essentially by herself she's a physician
14783.92s: in Radiology okay fantastic she's been
14786.36s: to the Olympics Olympics yes that is one
14788.44s: disciplined woman right so she's tough

14792.76s: 1 to 10 35 oh jeez yeah my mom what she
14796.96s: says goes and it definitely does have
14800.04s: its strain on the business it looks like

15862.52s: helping it turn around if you would have
15864.84s: met me when the restaurant first opened

21956.60s: by a charismatic entrepreneur named Zeke
21960.60s: ugast Zeke was 6'4 big and Goofy but you
21963.72s: know what the man knew how to have a
21964.84s: good time and he knew how to run a
21966.08s: pretty good restaurant everyone came to
21968.28s: zek when it first opened because there
21969.92s: was just a good vibe in this place good
21972.00s: people food was always good we used to
21974.88s: do 750 people in here on a Friday night
21978.00s: but in 2005 Zeke tragically died during
21981.32s: Hurricane Katrina and the ownership and
21983.64s: the direction of the restaurant was up
21985.48s: in the air after Katrina this place was
21987.84s: in
21988.68s: limbo so the cortell saw it and then
21991.80s: they pretty much took on the place hi
21993.80s: guys how are yall tonight welcome to
21995.20s: zekes when we bought zeks we chose to
21997.00s: keep the name because zeks did a very
21998.72s: good business and that just made
22000.40s: business sense to us all right guys
22002.20s: first guest when Daryl first took over
22004.04s: him pretty much changed everything he
22006.24s: cut staff he cut product he went to uh
22009.24s: lesser quality wouldn't feed that to
22011.24s: your dog and then on top of that he
22013.36s: raised the prices expensive it's a
22015.96s: little over the top I feel as though I'm
22017.96s: completely handcuffed in the kitchen dud

22090.08s: tell us what he thinks we can do
22091.56s: differently to change this because

23131.04s: frustrations the anger and the things
23133.76s: that really up set you the
23135.68s: most Emil um I I just feel as though I'm
23141.00s: getting pounded with a mallet constantly
23143.24s: when I walk into this
23144.80s: place I went from working 40 hours to
23147.92s: working about 50 for $400 a week that
23151.64s: pisses me
23154.08s: off I feel that we don't get any
23157.28s: respect I'm here all the time I don't
23159.72s: get to eat lunch I should have a meal I

23174.76s: openness and the honesty I knew it was
23176.56s: bad but I didn't quite understand it it
23178.20s: hit that um level of hurt I think it's
23181.40s: just sad that we're all sitting here and
23183.40s: that we actually have to even beat at
23184.88s: this point I think we all the whole
23187.80s: group of us here are pretty much
23189.44s: struggling no one's getting that message
23192.80s: across I need to to get through to them

23200.12s: want you to tell
23204.24s: them everybody was saying what they
23206.48s: wanted to say and getting it off their
23208.12s: chest but it's kind of different from
23210.56s: telling Chef Ramsey versus telling Daryl
23213.20s: don't be nervous I don't need to be
23214.84s: afraid I've got your

23258.88s: back Candace Ashley is that how you
23264.52s: feel you really do talk to us like dirt
23268.56s: sometimes my intent is not to talk down

23273.80s: out
23275.60s: Jason talk to Daryl please my biggest
23279.12s: problem that I have is just I don't

23289.60s: on the numbers the actual essence of
23292.12s: having a restaurant and serving good
23293.68s: food and giving customers service and
23295.80s: happy

23347.36s: me say something real quick since we're
23350.08s: all telling the truth first of all Daryl
23352.80s: and I have taken thousands and thousands
23354.76s: of dollars out of our personal account

23382.60s: not this is a business we have cost and
23385.04s: expenses I ask you to take that pay cut

23396.24s: [ __ ]
23398.16s: up
23400.00s: period if you don't want to be here
23402.44s: don't be here
23406.44s: after Chef Ramsey arranged for the staff
23408.20s: to air their grievances I don't think
23409.96s: you have a clue as to how this place
23412.40s: runs the defiant owners are not having
23414.84s: any of it if you don't want to be here
23416.96s: don't be
23419.32s: here if I were piling up money back
23421.84s: there then I could see you being pissed
23423.76s: off but we're not piling up money back
23425.64s: there I can't show appreciation in
23427.60s: dollars at this point they maybe have
23430.04s: this picture of me with this pile of
23431.28s: money going ha nobody's going to get it
23433.52s: we don't have the money I'm accepting
23435.08s: the truth from you guys accept it from
23437.00s: me
23438.14s: [Music]
23439.44s: please things aren't going well I
23441.60s: understand that but in terms of morale
23442.80s: there's an air of
23444.48s: discontent they feel abused and I'm not
23447.08s: saying the staff are perfect but you're
23449.24s: the owners and you set an example we
23452.12s: have to fix what's broken within so how
23454.72s: about starting over again and turning
23456.96s: the page and the beginning of a new
23460.72s: chapter I understand those frustrations

23493.60s: get Chef Ramsey off of his back we'll
23496.00s: see what happens oh
23499.00s: Lord after attempting to open Daryl and
23501.56s: Ellen's eyes to the staff morale
23503.36s: problems Chef Ramsey has devised a plan
23506.16s: to test the chefs and showcase their
23508.60s: abilities okay it's been so obvious that
